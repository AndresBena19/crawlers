{"body": "<p>Wednesday, March 30, 2016, Reading, PA \u2013 Initiative allows former community college students to obtain associate's degree with credits they've already earned.</p><p><strong>Harrisburg</strong> \u2013 Students who began their studies at a community college in Pennsylvania before transferring to a university within Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education might already have earned enough credits to receive their first degree. And now there's an easy way for them to get it, through the newly launched \"reverse transfer\" initiative.</p> <p>The 14 community colleges in the state and 14 State System universities today signed a statewide reverse transfer agreement that will allow students who have earned at least 60 total credits to apply for an associate's degree from the community college where they started.</p> <p>Receiving the degree could immediately enhance the student's earning potential, even as he or she continues working toward a bachelor's degree or other certification or credential at a State System university.</p> <p>\"The State System universities and the community colleges are natural partners,\" said State System Chancellor Frank T. Brogan. \"This agreement is another example of how we can work together on behalf of students all across the Commonwealth. It's a win-win for everyone.\"</p> <p>\"Collaborating with the State System on this agreement is the next step in the commitment of Pennsylvania's community colleges to increase student completion rates to benefit both students individually and the Commonwealth as a whole,\" said Luzerne County Community College President Thomas P. Leary, who also serves as chair of the Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges.<br/> A student who earns an associate's degree is more likely to complete the work necessary to\u00a0receive a bachelor's degree. \"If their studies toward a bachelor's degree are interrupted for any reason, with this program, they will still have their associate's degree, which will benefit them as they prepare to enter the workforce or will help enable them to move up the career ladder,\" said Elizabeth Bolden, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges.</p> <p>Many students who initially enroll at a community college do so with the intent of eventually earning a bachelor's degree, staying long enough to earn an associate's degree before transferring to a four-year college or university. Some leave before earning a degree, either to transfer or to go directly into the workforce.</p> <p>The Reverse Transfer Program gives those who transferred without a credential a pathway to their first college degree.</p> <p>\"Several State System universities already have reverse transfer agreements in place with their neighboring community college. This new agreement expands the program statewide, making it available to many more students across Pennsylvania,\" said Millersville University of Pennsylvania President John Anderson.</p> <p>Students who began their postsecondary education at any community college in Pennsylvania and earned a minimum of 45 credits before transferring to any State System university can participate in the new program. Eligible credits may include those earned through Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), Advanced Placement (AP), College Level Examination Program (CLEP), Credit by Exam and the military.</p> <p>A student must have enrolled at a State System university within five years of leaving the community college and have earned at least 15 additional credits at a State System university to be considered for the program. Their State System credits will be transferred back to the community college and applied to the requirements for the associate's degree.</p> <p>The State System universities will identify eligible students once they complete the 60 total credits and invite them to participate in the reverse transfer program. If interested, the eligible students will fill out a release form and their State System university transcript will be sent to the community college for review and evaluation.</p> <p>If approved, the community college will award the degree. Students will not be charged either a graduation or transcript fee by either institution involved.</p> <p>The first degrees could be awarded through the program as early as this summer. Many students likely already are eligible. Others could be once the current semester ends in May.</p> <p>\"The reverse transfer agreement is particularly helpful for students called to military service,\" said Jessica Shingara, a business management major at Millersville University and former student at Harrisburg Area Community College who spent five years in the U.S. Navy, where she was stationed aboard the USS John Paul Jones. \"Having long breaks from school can add stress to an already stressful situation, and having this program promotes an easy transition from serving to studying.\"</p> <p><strong><em>Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education</em></strong><em>\u00a0is the largest provider of undergraduate and graduate education in the Commonwealth, with about 107,000 degree-seeking students and thousands more who are enrolled in certificate and other career-development programs.

The Program has evolved over the years from a few sessions to a fully developed, four-session program that includes two off-campus retreats in the spring and fall, a three-day Winter Institute and a five-day Summer Institute.</p> <p>The celebration included dinner and a short formal program around 7 p.m. Representative Thomas Caltagirone presented a citation in honor of the occasion. The event also gave attendees the opportunity to reminisce about favorite activities and traditions, and included testimonials from current students and alumni. More than 50 students attended, including dozens of alumni who are now in graduate school or successfully working in their career field.</p> <p>Current students had the opportunity to talk with alumni and learn more about furthering their education and how RACC can help them to meet their future career goals.</p> <p>Over the years, the content of the Leadership Program has varied with sessions presented by 36 faculty members, 11 community guests, six administrators, and several student workers, mentors and alumni. For example, Mayor Tom McMahon attended a session and discussed civic responsibility. Session topics have covered a wide range, from Art Appreciation to Yoga. Many of the sessions have been directly related to leadership, such as team building, servant leadership, time management and goal setting.</p> <p>In addition to the institutes, the off-campus retreats have offered a wider range of activities conducive to team building, such as creative scavenger hunts and low and high ropes courses. Students learn concepts through hands-on, active participation, without grades and tests. Some activities build community through service. For example, the students in one Winter Institute went to an Olivet Boys and Girls Club center to paint the teen room.</p> <p>Diane Marabella, RACC's now retired Dean of Student Services, launched the Leadership Program in 2003 with a series of sessions initially just open to the leaders of the campus clubs and organizations.

Judd Meinhart, Program and Grants Administrator at Olivet, said the funds will go toward supporting the summer camp program that more than 800 area youth participate in, more than half of which will attend for free, because of donations.</p> <p>\"During the summer, our campers participate in a variety of activities including swimming, arts and crafts, field trips and recreational games,\" said Meinhart. \"We also engage our members in educational and character building activities to combat the summer learning loss that so many inner-city youth experience.</p> <p>\"Campers get the true camp experience once a week when they take a trip to Blue Mountain Camp in Hamburg for some old school camp fun like fishing, boating and exploring nature,\" Meinhart added.</p> <p>RACC raised the money through car washes, roller skating parties, yard sales and candy bar sales. The top individual fundraiser was student Alex Breidegam who raised $844.79, thanks in large part to selling more than 20 boxes of candy. The highest fundraising team was People That Kare, comprised of Phi Theta Kappa honor society students, raising $4,355.50.</p> <p>For more information, please contact Kim Uphold, Coordinator of Student Activities at <a href=\"mailto:kuphold@racc.edu\">kuphold@racc.edu</a> or 610-236-3943.</p>", "excerpt": "Thursday, May 9, 2013, Reading, PA \u2013 Students, faculty and staff from Reading Area Community College worked together to raise more than $16,000 for the Olivet Boys and Girls Club during this year's RACCy Olympics.", "id": 32, "title": "RACC Presents $16,000 Check to Olivet Boys and Girls Club"},
