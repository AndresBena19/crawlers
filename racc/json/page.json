Mr. Nagle also e-mailed me run-away slave ads from the Reading area dating back to 1758. He was very helpful when it came to e-mail, because he would always e-mail back within 24 hours.

I have also learned that Reading and Berks County was on the route of the runaway slaves escaping to Canada and nearby communities.

I attended school in Michigan, Arizona, and Oregon.

The CPAAM can also connect an individual to other locations throughout the county that served as stations for the underground railroad. Mr. Gilyard tells of stories of how slavery and segregation still has an effect on present day life, all connecting to the start of slavery.

Thomas Penn, one of the founders of the city of Reading, owned a well-known slave by the name of Virgil Warder (Johnson 159). Another recognized slave, Dinah Clark, \"engaged in almost every class of work generally done by strong men. She was born a slave on a farm in Bern township. When a small girl she was sold for $100 and received her freedom at the age of 21. After that she made her home in Reading\" (Underground).</p> <p>According to Berks County's Record of Slaves, 138 slaves were registered by 46 different slaveholders between June 9, 1780, and September 13, 1825. Out of these, 119 were recorded before November 1, 1780 and 19 were recorded as having been born after that date. The first two entries were both female slaves owned by two members of the Berks County Bar Association. \"The first \u0085 Phyllis, 24 years of age, \u0085was the property of James Biddle, Esq., the first member of the Berks County Bar and later the first President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. The second \u0085 Elizabeth, 22 years of age, a slave belonging to Collinson Read, Esq., another member of the Bar and the son of James Read, our first Prothonotary\" (Schaeffer 5).</p> <p>According to Schaeffer, the largest slaveholders in Berks County in 1780 were:</p> <blockquote>Mark Bird, of Birdsboro, with 18 slaves; John Lesher, of Oley Forge at what is now Spangsville, Oley Township, with 15; John Patton, who married the widow of William Bird, the father of Mark, and carried on the Berkshire Furnace in Lower Heidelberg (now South Heidelberg) Township, 14 slaves; George Ege, of Charming Forge, Marion Township, 10 slaves; Christian Lower, of Tulpehocken Township, 8 slaves; and Samuel Mifflin, merchant, of Reading, 5 slaves (5).</blockquote> <p>All of these slave owners were iron-masters with the exception of Mifflin who was a businessman.</p> <p>Hopewell Furnace, owned by Mark Bird, the largest slave owner in Berks County, used African American workers. Bird's \"slaves were put to work at his forges in Birdsboro, and are said to have dug Hopewell's original headrace, which powered a water wheel that, in turn, provided air to fire the furnace there\" (Davis 5). \"No positive proof was found that slaves were used at Hopewell, but the records were clear that Mark Bird possessed slaves during the time he was the owner of the Furnace\" (Walker 305).</p> <p>\"On the other hand there were circumstances which indicate that Negroes from the South worked here. Most of the 107 names collected from the Hopewell books appeared very briefly, often only one entry, to suggest the possibility of persons passing through\" (Walker 307). For example, \"'Black Frank' worked for 15 days in the autumn of 1802 and was not heard from again. 'Black Dine' came on June 22,1803, and on July 14 'went away' after collecting her wages. 'Black Luce' served as a maid for 10 weeks\" (Walker 310). One could only speculate why these workers were transient.</p> <p>According to Walker, \"Israel Acrelius observed many Negro slaves working at the Pennsylvania furnaces during his travels in the 1750's. He thought they were better treated here than anywhere else in America\" (305). It is not surprising that iron masters in Berks County had more male slaves than female slaves. There was one exception. John Lesher's group was composed of 3 men, 3 women, 5 boys, and 4 girls (Schaeffer 5). Since males were more valuable to iron masters, one might question Lesher's rationale.</p> <p>As to whether slaves in Berks County took on the surnames of their masters, authorities seem to agree that this did not happen in the North to the extent it did in the South. \"There were no known Blacks in Berks County with name Potts, Bird, Ege, Old, Lesher, Rutter, etc. There was, however, one indentured mulatto owned by George Ege whose name was George Greenfield. The indenture revealed that this mulatto at the age of six was owned by one James Greenfield; hence it is quite unlikely that the identical surname of the two is a coincidence\"(Johnson 161).</p> <p>Sometimes a slave's name might be an indicator of his heritage. For example, Ebo was a slave who was listed in the personal inventory and appraisements of William Bird of Robeson Township. \"The Ibos are a tribe in West Africa located in what is now the southern part of the Federation of Nigeria. They are a highly intelligent people trained by the British in the ways of business. Names such as Ebo, therefore, give one a clue as to the tribal origins of certain Blacks in this country\" (Johnson 161).</p> <p>Sometimes a name reflected the slave's relationship with his master. For instance, \"Joseph E. Walker refers to a runaway slave belonging to Mark Bird by the name of Cuff Dix and maintains that the name 'Cuff' was used for slaves who were troublemakers. This probably explains the origin of its colloquial usage among elderly blacks while chaffing each other\" (Johnson 161).</p> <p>Unfortunately, some slaves in Berks County were mistreated by their masters. \"A tourist in Berks County in 1928 describes a 'slave pen' seen in the cellar of a Berks County farms.The 'slave pen' was 9'X10' in size and was constructed with 2\" X 2\" bars spaced about five inches apart. The practice of having slave pens was very common as they were seen on other nearby farms\"(Johnson 187).</p> <p>Many slaves attempted to escape their masters despite the consequences. Edward R. Turner, a leading authority on slavery in Pennsylvania, states that \"runaways were frequently caught by the local authorities, who put them in jail, advertised for the masters to come and get them, and kept them until the masters came, or if they did not come, perhaps set them free\"(Johnson 185).</p> <p>Sometimes runaway slaves were worth a lot of money to their owners. \"Ten dollars was an appreciable amount of money in 1800. It paid a month's wages for a team driver; two days of a congressman's salary; bought ten subscriptions to <em>The Weekly Advertiser</em>, or bought three books\" (Johnson 188). Even Mark Bird advertised for runaway slaves. \"Cuff Dix, a skilled hammerman, escaped in 1774 and again in 1775; in the latter year he was apprehended in Delaware but disappeared from the New Castle jail before he could be returned to Bird\"(Walker 305).</p> <p>Both anonymous and signed ads were placed in local newspapers for the hire and sale of blacks. \"While most of the ads appearing in the Reading papers were, to be sure, anonymous, there were ads for both hire and sale of Blacks signed by one William Bell.It is quite possible that some of the unsigned ads also belonged to Bell\"(Johnson 186). \"There is strong evidence indicating that William Bell was, indeed, a slave broker. Deed books in the county courthouse further show that he owned property throughout the county, some of it in areas where there were iron furnaces with Black people in the close proximity\"(Johnson186). \"The <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Reading Zeitung</span> of Dec. 29, 1800 contains the advertisement of William Bell, who offers a 'stray Negro Wench' for sale. 'She has had small pox and is industrious.' In the same newspaper on the same date Fred K. Bechtel offers at public sale 'a Negro man about 26 years old, strong and hardy'\" (Underground)</p> <p>Sometimes ads appeared that would offer a slave's time such as the one in <em>The Weekly Advertiser </em>for January 28, 1804: \"TO BE SOLD THE TIME OF A NEGRO MAN, who has to serve two years and eleven Months-he understands Farming and driving a Wagon-he is honest\"(Johnson 185). Another ad had a very unusual twist. It read \"TO BE SOLD THE TIME OF A YOUNG AND HEALTHY NEGRO WENCH.The Owner will not dispose of her to any person living in or around the borough of Reading\" (Johnson 185). One could only imagine what be the motivating factor behind running such an ad.</p> <p>Two cartoons were discovered with an anti-slavery theme. One was taken from Readinger Adler Magazine of 1819. \"It affords an interesting side-light on the abolition sentiment in our country four decades before the Civil War, which ended with the suppression of slavery (Shenton &amp; Weber 18). The second, \"also dealing with local slavery, is a relic of the bitter gubernatorial campaign of 1820 in Pennsylvania, when our own Joseph Hiester was opposing William Findlay. This cartoon shows Hiester savagely wielding the lash over cringing negroes\" (Shenton &amp; Weber 18). It is evident that the same political smear campaigns that occur today existed even back then.</p> <p>The local newspaper also relayed stories of various murders and insurrections that occurred throughout the country. \"One killing that occurred in a neighboring county was reported in <em>The Weekly Advertiser</em>. 'We hear, a Negro man, named Butler, was taken up in Northampton County-for killing his Master and Mistress-and passed thro' this place for Lancaster'\"(Johnson 188).</p> <p>No case ever stirred up such anxiety as the arrest of a fugitive slave. This was very unusual in that ninety percent of the courtroom audience consisted of black men and women. Cooley, a slave owner from Maryland, swore out a warrant for the arrest of \"James Turner, commonly called Jim, a colored man, who had escaped from the 'labor and service' of Cooley.\" The judge (without the assistance of a jury) listened to the evidence and ruled in Turner's favor (Fryer).</p> <p>William Still, author of the book <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Underground Railroad</span>, had ties to Berks County. According to Frank Gilyard, President of the Central Pennsylvania African American Museum (CPAAM), \"Still's brother, Edgar, was a runaway slave who came to Berks County. Edgar was the founder of the colored Elks on Walnut Street in Reading. He is still recognized the first Sunday in May. He had a daughter who graduated from Albright College but was not able to gain employment in this area.\"</p> <p>The wooded area of southeastern Pennsylvania was the perfect sanctuary for slaves escaping from the South. In addition, many individuals risked helping these refugees. \"George Washington wrote to a friend on November 20, 1786, that it was almost impossible to recover a negro who made his way to this area because there were so many people who would 'facilitate the escape'\" (Walker 306-307). This underground network of individuals would be part of the \"Underground Railroad and the 'train' would occasionally be nicknamed the 'Gospel Train'\"(Dobard 62). \"It is the story of a people's struggle for freedom echoed in the words of Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglas declaring their intentions to 'live free or die'\" (Dobard 66).</p> <p>Berks County was part of the Underground Railroad. Many of Hopewell and Joanna Furnace's African-American workers lived in the nearby forest called Six Penny Creek. \"From 1835 on, this area became known as a safe haven for runaway slaves . The fugitives traveled across the Hopewell hills to the home of Quakers Elizabeth Scarlett and her son, Joseph (owners of Scarlett's Mills)\" (Davis 5). \"The forested hills and the remote huts of the colliers and wood cutters made ideal hiding places until the search ended and it was safe to move on north. While they were hiding, the Negroes could earn their food and some money\" (Walker 307).</p> <p>Churches also played a major role in abolition movement. \"These included the Quakers, members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church\" (Dobard 63). \"Learning the language and the rituals of Christianity allowed the slaves to gather together and sing and speak with words that held one meaning for the masters, another for the slaves. Many hymns and spirituals were interpreted by the slaves and contained hidden meanings\"(Dobard 60). In order to prevent this, \"Laws were passed to curtail such communication, including . drumming, since it was feared to be a means of secret communication brought over from Africa\" (Dobard 64-65). After the \"talking drum\" was banned, slaves used songs to transmit their messages (Gilyard). \"A great deal of Christian symbols and songs about the Underground Railroad was conveyed through encoded songs and became the rallying cry for many a slave in need of persevering grace and in search of the 'promised land'\"(Dobard 60).</p> <p>Quilts were also used to relay messages. Recently, a secret code designed by slaves was revealed. The Quilt Code \"confirms the use of quilts as visual maps to freedom\" (Dobard 67). For example, the Monkey Wrench pattern told the slaves to get the gather all necessary tools. The Wagon Wheel pattern \"signaled the slaves to pack all the things that would go in a wagon or that would be used in transit.\" The Tumbling Boxes pattern indicated that it was time to escape. \"The code had dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey\" (Dobard 70).</p> <p>Mt. Frisby A.M.E. Church, located in Birdsboro, was a place where \"runaways could rest and re-group before continuing the trip to more northern regions\" (Davis 5). \"This church has the largest slave cemetery in Pennsylvania that is currently being maintained by the Cole family\" (Gilyard).</p> <p>Another church that was active in the Underground Railroad was the Bethel AME Church located in Reading. \"Built in 1837, Bethel is the only AME church in Berks County that was constructed through the private resources of its congregation, many of whom were employed in Reading's iron industry\" (NPS). It was here that an underground hideaway called 'The Pit' was used to 'hide as many as twenty slaves' (Gilyard). \"Jacob Ross, one of the founding members of the church, was himself a runaway slave from Virginia who had found support in the local black community and decided to settle in Reading\" (NPS).</p> <p>Recently, Jason P. Shellenhamer, a senior anthropology student at Franklin and Marshall College, made an interesting discovery, on a property off route 61, in Ontelaunee Township. He uncovered evidence of a tunnel system that was \"likely part of the Underground Railroad.The tunnel starts at the barn, which would have been a strategic location for slaves who traveled along rivers and creeks en route to Canada\" (Henshaw 1). The original builder, Thomas Parvin, was a Quaker who \"signed a statement for the abolition of slavery.according to a genealogical report\" (Henshaw 1).</p> <p>Since the newspaper article was written on October 11, 2000, additional evidence has been unearthed. \"Blue beads and three collars have been found. Blue beads were a 'sign' that slaves left behind to show they were there\" (Gilyard).</p> <p>Unfortunately, this scenario has a disheartening twist. A lawsuit is pending which may prevent the preservation of this historical marker. It is unfortunate that a road that would destroy a piece of history may take precedence over this matter.</p> <p>It is no wonder that slaves found salvation in Berks County. Many individuals were committed to their cause. Although there were those who opposed the abolition of slavery, many more detested the idea of owning another individual. They found it appalling that a person could be the personal \"property\" of another. Slavery is part of our history that must not be ignored.</p> <br/> <br/>Robin Wagar <br/>28 November 2000 <hr width=\"100%\"/> <br/> <a href=\"../ugrr_dir/tablecont.aspx\">Return to Research Directory Table of Contents</a> <br/><a href=\"../ugrr_main.aspx\">Return to Underground Railroad Project Main Page</a> <br/><a href=\"../../../../default.aspx\">Return to RACC's Home Page</a> <br/> <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div>", "uid": "0", "title": null, "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Faculty/lawlor/ugrr_prj/wagar/berkslav.aspx", "path": "/Faculty/lawlor/ugrr_prj/wagar/berkslav.aspx", "folder": "/Faculty/lawlor/ugrr_prj/wagar"},

And I share with them one thing: The PHD Principle: Perseverance, Hard Work and Determination. </p> <p><strong><u>Perseverance</u></strong> is defined as steady persistence in adhering to a course of action, a belief, or a purpose; steadfastness; or what one may call \"stick-to-it-ness\". Be committed to your commitments. Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare: The race is not always won by the fastest but the one that can endure the longest.</p> <p> <strong><u>Hard Work.</u></strong> We have all heard that anything worth having is worth working for. You must be willing to invest in your academic success by putting the necessary time and energy into your classes. Studies show that students must study one hour for every credit hour registered. <br/> </p> <p>Lastly, <strong><u>Determination</u></strong> is defined as firmness of purpose; resolve. Turn your dream in to reality by being serious in your efforts and finishing the drill. </p> <p> When the <strong>PHD</strong> principle\u2013Perseverance, Hard Work, and Determination\u2013is employed, academic success is sure to follow. </p> <p><strong>5 Tips for Academic Success</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Make a to-do list every day. </strong><br/> Put things that are most important at the top of the list and do them first. And don't forget to reward yourself for your accomplishments.</li> <li><strong>Make sure the faculty knows you.</strong><br/> Sit in the front of the classroom. Participate in class discussions. Consult with your teachers during office hours.</li> <li><strong>Review your notes every day.</strong><br/> Reviewing helps you reinforce what you have learned, so you need less time to study before a test. You'll also be ready if you get called on in class or have to take a pop quiz.</li> <li><strong>Establish a regular study routine, and study during daylight hours.</strong><br/> Find a place that is comfortable\u2013but not <em>too </em>comfortable\u2013and always do your studying there, preferably during the same hours each day. Also, keep in mind that you're about 1.5 times more productive during daylight hours than when the sun is down.</li> <li><strong>Keep your eyes on the prize.</strong><br/> Clarify your goals. Know why you are in college in the first place. Visualize your success on daily basis.</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0</p> </div> <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div>", "uid": "0", "title": null, "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Faculty/JTshibangu/advice.aspx", "path": "/Faculty/JTshibangu/advice.aspx", "folder": "/Faculty/JTshibangu"},

What is Ebola virus disease?</strong> <br/> Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90%. The illness affects humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). <br/> Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in a village near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the other in a remote area of Sudan. <br/> The origin of the virus is unknown but fruit bats (Pteropodidae) are considered the likely host of the Ebola virus, based on available evidence.</p> <p><strong>2. How do people become infected with the virus?</strong> <br/> In the current outbreak in West Africa, the majority of cases in humans have occurred as a result of human-to-human transmission. <br/> Infection occurs from direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people. Infection can also occur if broken skin or mucous membranes of a healthy person come into contact with environments that have become contaminated with an Ebola patient's infectious fluids such as soiled clothing, bed linen, or used needles.<br/> More than 100 health-care workers have been exposed to the virus while caring for Ebola patients. This happens because they may not have been wearing personal protection equipment or were not properly applying infection prevention and control measures when caring for the patients. Health-care providers at all levels of the health system \u2013 hospitals, clinics, and health posts \u2013 should be briefed on the nature of the disease and how it is transmitted, and strictly follow recommended infection control precautions.<br/> <strong>WHO does not advise families or communities to care for individuals who may present with symptoms of Ebola virus disease in their homes</strong>. Rather, seek treatment in a hospital or treatment centre staffed by doctors and nurses qualified and equipped to treat Ebola virus victims. If you do choose to care for your loved one at home, WHO strongly advises you to notify your local public health authority and receive appropriate training, equipment (gloves and personal protective equipment [PPE]) for treatment, instructions on proper removal and disposal of PPE, and information on how to prevent further infection and transmission of the disease to yourself, other family members, or the community.<br/> Additional transmission has occurred in communities during funerals and burial rituals. Burial ceremonies in which mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased person have played a role in the transmission of Ebola. Persons who have died of Ebola must be handled using strong protective clothing and gloves and must be buried immediately. WHO advises that the deceased be handled and buried by trained case management professionals, who are equipped to properly bury the dead.<br/> People are infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. For this reason, infected patients receive close monitoring from medical professionals and receive laboratory tests to ensure the virus is no longer circulating in their systems before they return home. When the medical professionals determine it is okay for the patient to return home, they are no longer infectious and cannot infect anyone else in their communities. Men who have recovered from the illness can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for up to 7 weeks after recovery. For this reason, it is important for men to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 7 weeks after recovery or to wear condoms if having sexual intercourse during 7 weeks after recovery.<br/> Generally, a person must come into contact with an animal that has Ebola and it can then spread within the community from human to human.</p> <p><strong>3. Who is most at risk?</strong> <br/> During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>health workers; </li> <li>family members or others in close contact with infected people; </li> <li>mourners who have direct contact with the bodies of the deceased as part of burial ceremonies. </li> </ul> <p>More research is needed to understand if some groups, such as immuno-compromised people or those with other underlying health conditions, are more susceptible than others to contracting the virus.<br/> Exposure to the virus can be controlled through the use of protective measures in clinics and hospitals, at community gatherings, or at home.</p> <p><strong>4. What are typical signs and symptoms of infection?</strong> <br/> Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat are typical signs and symptoms. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. <br/> Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts, and elevated liver enzymes.<br/> The incubation period, or the time interval from infection to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. The patients become contagious once they begin to show symptoms. They are not contagious during the incubation period. <br/> Ebola virus disease infections can only be confirmed through laboratory testing. </p> <p><strong>5. When should someone seek medical care? </strong> <br/> If a person has been in an area known to have Ebola virus disease or in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola and they begin to have symptoms, they should seek medical care immediately. <br/> Any cases of persons who are suspected to have the disease should be reported to the nearest health unit without delay. Prompt medical care is essential to improving the rate of survival from the disease. It is also important to control spread of the disease and infection control procedures need to be started immediately. </p> <p><strong>6. What is the treatment?</strong> <br/> Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They are frequently dehydrated and need intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions that contain electrolytes. There is currently no specific treatment to cure the disease. <br/> Some patients will recover with the appropriate medical care. <br/> To help control further spread of the virus, people that are suspected or confirmed to have the disease should be isolated from other patients and treated by health workers using strict infection control precautions. </p> <p><strong>7. What can I do? Can it be prevented? Is there a vaccine?</strong> <br/> Currently, there is no licensed medicine or vaccine for Ebola virus disease, but several products are under development. <br/> <strong>Ways to prevent infection and transmission</strong> <br/> While initial cases of Ebola virus disease are contracted by handling infected animals or carcasses, secondary cases occur by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an ill person, either through unsafe case management or unsafe burial practices. During this outbreak, most of the disease has spread through human-to-human transmission. Several steps can be taken to help in preventing infection and limiting or stopping transmission.</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Understand the nature of the disease, how it is transmitted, and how to prevent it from spreading further. (For additional information, please see the previous questions about Ebola virus disease in this FAQ.) </li> <li>Listen to and follow directives issued by your country's respective Ministry of Health. </li> <li>If you suspect someone close to you or in your community of having Ebola virus disease, encourage and support them in seeking appropriate medical treatment in a health-care facility. </li> <li>If you choose to care for an ill person in your home, notify public health officials of your intentions so they can train you and provide appropriate gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, impermeable gown, boots/closed shoes with overshoes, mask and eye protection for splashes), as well as instructions as a reminder on how to properly care for the patient, protect yourself and your family, and properly dispose of the PPE after use. <strong>N.B. WHO does not recommend home care and strongly advises individuals and their family members to seek professional care in a treatment centre.</strong></li> <li>When visiting patients in the hospital or caring for someone at home, hand washing with soap and water is recommended after touching a patient, being in contact with their bodily fluids, or touching his/her surroundings. </li> <li>People who have died from Ebola should only be handled using appropriate protective equipment and should be buried immediately by public health professionals who are trained in safe burial procedures. </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, individuals should reduce contact with high-risk infected animals (i.e. fruit bats, monkeys or apes) in the affected rainforest areas. If you suspect an animal is infected, do not handle it. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before eating.</p> <p><strong>8. What about health workers? How should they protect themselves while caring for patients? </strong> <br/> Health workers treating patients with suspected or confirmed illness are at higher risk of infection than other groups. During an outbreak a number of important actions will reduce or stop the spread of the virus and protect health workers and others in the health-care setting. These actions are called \"standard and other additional precautions\" and are evidence-based recommendations known to prevent the spread of infections. The following questions and answers describe the precautions in detail.<br/> <strong>Should patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus be separated from other patients?</strong> <br/> Isolating patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease in single isolation rooms is recommended. Where isolation rooms are not available, it is important to assign designated areas, separate from other patients, for suspected and confirmed cases. In these designated areas, suspect and confirmed cases should also be separate. Access to these areas should be restricted, needed equipment should be dedicated strictly to suspected and confirmed EVD treatment areas, and clinical and non-clinical personnel should be exclusively assigned to isolation rooms and dedicated areas.<br/> <strong>Are visitors allowed in areas where patients suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease are admitted?</strong> <br/> Stopping visitor access to patients infected with EVD is preferred. If this is not possible, access should be given only to those individuals who are necessary for the patient's well-being and care, such as a child's parent.<br/> <strong>Is protective equipment required when caring for these patients?</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>In addition to standard health-care precautions, health-care workers should strictly apply recommended infection control measures to avoid exposure to infected blood, fluids, or contaminated environments or objects \u2013 such as a patient's soiled linen or used needles. </li> <li>All visitors and health-care workers should rigorously use what is known as personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE should include at least: gloves, an impermeable gown, boots/closed shoes with overshoes, a mask, and eye protection for splashes (goggles or face shields). </li> </ul> <p><strong>Is hand hygiene important?</strong> <br/> Hand hygiene is essential and should be performed:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>before donning gloves and wearing PPE on entry to the isolation room/area; </li> <li>before any clean or aseptic procedures is being performed on a patient; </li> <li>after any exposure risk or actual exposure with a patient's blood or body fluids; </li> <li>after touching (even potentially) contaminated surfaces, items, or equipment in the patient's surroundings; and </li> <li>after removal of PPE, upon leaving the isolation area. </li> </ul> <p>It is important to note that neglecting to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE will reduce or negate any benefits of the PPE.<br/> Either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and running water can be used for hand hygiene, applying the correct technique recommended by WHO. It is important to always perform hand hygiene with soap and running water when hands are visibly soiled. Alcohol-based hand rubs should be made available at every point of care (at the entrance and within the isolation rooms and areas); running water, soap, and single use towels should also be always available. <br/> <strong>What other precautions are necessary in the health-care setting?</strong> <br/> Other key precautions are safe injection and phlebotomy procedures, including safe management of sharps, regular and rigorous environmental cleaning, decontamination of surfaces and equipment, and management of soiled linen and of waste. <br/> In addition, it is important to ensure safe processing of laboratory samples from suspected or confirmed patients with EDV and safe handling of dead bodies or human remains for post-mortem examination and burial preparation. Any health-care workers and other professionals undertaking these tasks in connection with suspected or confirmed patients with Ebola virus disease should wear appropriate PPE and follow precautions and procedures recommended by WHO. </p> <p><strong>9. What about rumours that some foods can prevent or treat the infection? </strong> <br/> WHO strongly recommends that people seek credible health advice about Ebola virus disease from their public health authority. <br/> While there is no specific drug against Ebola, the best treatment is intensive supportive treatment provided in the hospital by health workers using strict infection control procedures. The infection can be controlled through recommended protective measures.</p> <p><strong>10. How does WHO protect health during outbreaks?</strong> <br/> WHO provides technical advice to countries and communities to prepare for and respond to Ebola outbreaks. <br/> WHO actions include:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>disease surveillance and information-sharing across regions to watch for outbreaks; </li> <li>technical assistance to investigate and contain health threats when they occur \u2013 such as on-site help to identify sick people and track disease patterns; </li> <li>advice on prevention and treatment options; </li> <li>deployments of experts and the distribution of health supplies (such as personal protection gear for health workers) when they are requested by the country; </li> <li>communications to raise awareness of the nature of the disease and protective health measures to control transmission of the virus; and </li> <li>activation of regional and global networks of experts to provide assistance, if requested, and mitigate potential international health effects and disruptions of travel and trade. </li> </ul> <p><strong>11. During an outbreak, numbers of cases reported by health officials can go up and down? Why?</strong> <br/> During an Ebola outbreak, the affected country's public health authority reports its disease case numbers and deaths. Figures can change daily. Case numbers reflect both suspected cases and laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola. Sometimes numbers of suspected and confirmed cases are reported together. Sometimes they are reported separately. Thus, numbers can shift between suspected and confirmed cases.<br/> Analyzing case data trends, over time, and with additional information, is generally more helpful to assess the public health situation and determine the appropriate response.</p> <p><strong>12. Is it safe to travel during an outbreak? What is WHO's travel advice?</strong> <br/> During an outbreak, WHO reviews the public health situation regularly and recommends any travel or trade restrictions, if necessary, and may inform national authorities to implement it. WHO is currently reviewing its recommendations for travel and expects to issue advice in the coming days. <br/> While travellers should always be vigilant with regard to their health and those around them, the risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of an infected patient. <br/> <strong>Is it safe to travel with persons who have Ebola?</strong> <br/> As with any illness or disease, it is always possible that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus may choose to travel. If the individual has not developed symptoms (see FAQ #4), they cannot transmit EVD to those around them. If the individual does have symptoms, they should seek immediate medical attention at the first sign they are feeling unwell. This may require either notifying the flight crew or ship crew or, upon arrival at a destination, seeking immediate medical attention. Travellers who show initial symptoms of EVD should be isolated to prevent further transmission. Although the risk to fellow travellers in such a situation is very low, contact tracing is recommended under these circumstances.<br/> <strong>Is it safe to travel to West Africa on business or to visit family and friends?</strong> <br/> The risk of a tourist or businessman/woman becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to the local areas from which primary cases have been reported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected living or dead persons or animal, all of which are unlikely exposures for the average traveller. In any event, tourists are advised to avoid all such contacts.<br/> If you are visiting family or friends in the affected areas, the risk is similarly low, unless you have direct physical contact with a person who is ill or who has died. If this is the case, it is important to notify public health authorities and engage in contact tracing. Contact tracing is used to confirm you have not been exposed to EVD and to prevent further spread of the disease through monitoring.<br/> <strong>WHO's general travel advice</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Travelers should avoid all contact with infected patients. </li> <li>Health workers traveling to affected areas should strictly follow WHO-recommended infection control guidance. </li> <li>Anyone who has stayed in areas where cases were recently reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness. </li> <li>Clinicians caring for travelers returning from affected areas with compatible symptoms are advised to consider the possibility of Ebola virus disease. </li> </ul> <p>For additional travel advice, please read the Travel and transport risk assessment: Recommendations for public health authorities and transport sector at <a href=\"http://who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/\" target=\"_blank\">http://who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> </div> <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div>", "uid": "0", "title": null, "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Faculty/JTshibangu/news.aspx", "path": "/Faculty/JTshibangu/news.aspx", "folder": "/Faculty/JTshibangu"},

{"body": "<h2>Going Once, Going Twice... Become an Auctioneer</h2> <p><img alt=\"Dick Henry- Auctioneer\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"300\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/News/Features//News/Features/images/dick_henry.jpg\" width=\"200\"/>Twenty years ago, Dick Henry was running a gas station. Now, he's hosting benefit auctions for organizations like the Berks County Humane Society and the Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue.</p> <p>Dick's career path has taken many twists and turns since his days at the gas station. The latest twist landed him in the Auctioneering Certification Program at Reading Area Community College.</p> <p>While working in real estate, Dick attended a business brokerage seminar and was impressed with the presenter's public speaking skills. </p> <p>\"I asked him where he learned public speaking,\" Dick recalled. \"He said, 'You're never going to believe this, but I became an auctioneer.'\"</p> <p>Dick was more than familiar with the auctioneering concept thanks to many weekends with his dad.</p> <p>\"My dad was an auction junkie, and I would always go with him,\" said Dick. \"In the car business I went to a lot, and I always enjoyed the chant and the interaction, but I never had the desire.\"</p> <p>When he realized it would enhance his public speaking skills, Dick checked out RACC's program and enrolled in 2004. </p> <p>\"You really don't know what to expect when you start,\" he said. \"The one thing you think about when it comes to auctioneering is the chant and being able to call bids. Being a successful auctioneer is so much more than that.\"</p> <p>While the program teaches the chanting, the curriculum also includes procurement and appraisal of personal property and real estate, laws and regulations, and preparation for auctions.</p> <p> \"It's a lot of hard work, cramming a lot of education into your brain for 10 weeks,\" said Dick, who has been teaching the program for two years. \"I've always had happy students who enjoy the interaction with each other.\"</p> <p>To finish the program, students are also required to participate in a practicum, where they gain hands-on experience with a licensed auctioneer. Whether it is clerking, keeping records or actually selling items, students must complete a minimum of 60 hours.</p> <p>After completing RACC's program, Dick went for specialty training for benefit auctions through the National Auctioneers Association. He has since hosted auctions for the American Red Cross, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the RACC Scholarship Fund, and numerous churches and civic organizations.</p> <p>\"You really get addicted to it, but you also realize that you are there to do a job,\" he said.</p> <p>The next session of the College's auctioneering program starts March 11, 2013. To help students with the cost, two scholarships have been established by an anonymous benefactor in Dick Henry's name.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "The Path to Auctioneering", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/auctioneering.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/auctioneering.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

A request for a cataloged item that is available through the ALIN network is an intralibrary loan request and is processed using the ALIN \u201cHold\u201d procedure although a request for a periodical article that is available within the ALIN network is considered an interlibrary loan.. </p> <p>The Yocum Library's <a href=\"history.aspx\">mission</a> provides the foundation for its provision of interlibrary loan services. Due to the high costs involved in the interlibrary loan process, this service is provided only to members of the RACC community \u2013 RACC students, staff, faculty, trustees, and alumni. Other library patrons should be referred to their public, college, or corporate libraries to obtain interlibrary loan services.</p> <p>Members of the RACC community who are eligible for interlibrary loan services must have current library cards and no blocks, fines, charges, or overdue items on their library accounts. A library patron, who does not pick up an interlibrary loan item after notification of its receipt by The Yocum Library, will have a message placed on his/her library account; three or more such messages will block the patron from making more interlibrary loan requests from The Yocum Library. The Yocum Library reserves the right to deny interlibrary loan services to anyone who has not complied with the interlibrary loan policies and procedures in the past.</p> <p>Because of the delay involved in obtaining interlibrary loan materials, an interlibrary loan request should be the product of a session with a librarian, so that the patron is first provided with as much information as possible from The Yocum Library's resources.</p> <p>The Yocum Library reserves the right to refuse a request which violates local, state, or federal laws, such as, but not limited to, copyright violations.</p> <h2>Borrowing Costs for RACC Library Patrons</h2> <p>Internal costs of interlibrary loan transactions are part of the library budget. Any additional charge that is set by the lending library is to be paid by the library patron who originates the request. </p> <p>Because of the serious obligation to adhere to all guidelines and rules set by the lending library, interlibrary loan items must be returned to The Yocum Library by the due date. A renewal of an interlibrary loan item must be requested one week prior to the due date although there is no guarantee that the lending library will renew the item.<br/><br/> Contact the Head of Interlibrary Loan of The Yocum Library or email the request to <a href=\"mailto:library@racc.edu\">library@racc.edu</a></p> <p>A patron who fails to return an interlibrary loan item by the due date will have a message placed on his/her library account; three or more such messages will block the patron from making more interlibrary loan requests from The Yocum Library.<br/> Library patrons, who do not return interlibrary loan materials to The Yocum Library will be responsible for all charges and expenses that are levied by the lending library..</p> <h2>Interlibrary Loans Requested By Other Libraries</h2> <p>The Yocum Library accepts interlibrary loan (ILL) requests from organized libraries in the United States and its territories and from international libraries that provide proof of physical location. Requests are accepted by OCLC, by mail, by phone, by fax, or by e-mail.</p> <p>The Yocum Library reserves the right to refuse a request that violates local, state, or federal laws, such as, but not limited to copyright violations.</p> <p>Materials are lent to other libraries regardless of format. Availability of items depends on the need for the material by the patrons of The Yocum Library. Photocopies of periodical articles that are sent as an ILL request need not be returned by the requesting library. In most cases, materials on reserve or in reference cannot be loaned. The Director of Library Services may approve loan of a reserve or reference item. Items are lent for 4 weeks. Renewals must be requested one week before the item is due back to The Yocum Library.</p> <h2>Borrowing Costs for Libraries</h2> <p>The Yocum Library lends materials without charge to </p> <ul> <li>Berks County libraries </li> <li>Pennsylvania community college, Pennsylvania SSHE university, and Pennsylvania correctional institution libraries </li> <li>Libraries who do not charge The Yocum Library for ILL requests </li> </ul> <p>The Yocum Library lends materials at a fee to: </p> <ul> <li>Libraries who charge The Yocum Library for ILL requests </li> <li>For-profit institution libraries </li> </ul> <p>Fees to be charged: </p> <ul> <li>Returnable loan of item $10./request </li> <li>Non-returnable loan of an item $10./item </li> </ul> <h2>Replacement Costs for Libraries</h2> <p>Borrowing libraries that do not return ILL items to The Yocum Library by the date set by the Head of Interlibrary Loan will be charged the replacement cost plus $10.00 processing charge per item. If an item cannot be replaced, a default cost that includes the processing charge will be billed to the borrowing library:<br/> $20 for a mass market paperback<br/> $30 for a trade paperback<br/> $60 for a hardback book<br/> $40 for a feature film in DVD or VHS formats<br/> $200 for a documentary film<br/> $30 for a sound recording<br/> $35 for an art print<br/> $20 for a map</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Interlibrary Loan Policies", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Yocum/policy_ill.aspx", "path": "/Yocum/policy_ill.aspx", "folder": "/Yocum"},

An assistant production manager at a Berks County company, he was laid off and looking for a new direction.</p> <p>Rich talked to friends, knocked on doors, and reached out to businesses to find anything to get his life back on track. At the end of the search, he found RACC and its tuition waiver policy for recently laid-off employees in Berks County.</p> <p>In December 2009, Rich enrolled at RACC in the mechatronics associate degree program, offered through the Schmidt Training and Technology Center (STTC).</p> <p>\"The biggest challenge was regrouping and getting my focus back,\" said Rich, a native of Schuylkill County. \"I was traveling down this road and then a curve ball was thrown at me that I wasn't expecting.\"</p> <p>It was the staff and students alike at the STTC that offered Rich, 36, a support system and advice to help him regain the focus he needed to succeed.</p> <p>\"Everybody has a story,\" said Rich, who was the first in his family to go to college in 1995. \"They really help you and tell you that you can do this. That was really the difference for me.\" </p> <p>Rich was not a stranger to college, as he already earned an associate degree in machines trade technology from Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.</p> <p> \"I wanted to use the foundation I already had and build on that,\" he said. \"It was going to be an accumulation of knowledge.\"</p> <p>Rich is currently taking Advanced Manufacturing Integrated Systems Technology (AMIST) courses, along with Math and English Composition. He is on pace to earn his degree in 2013. </p> <p>In addition to taking classes, Rich also works as an instructor aid at the STTC, helping with the mechanical and electrical labs. In fact, earlier this school year, he received the Schmidt Technology Teaching Scholarship, which is awarded to a student interested in teaching in the technology field.</p> <p> \"I have to learn by application and get my hands on something,\" he said. \"I memorize things quicker by showing them to other people, so they benefit and I benefit.\" </p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Picking Up the Pieces", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/richfasnacht.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/richfasnacht.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

If staff cannot locate a parent/guardian, RACC Security will be notified as well as police and children services if necessary.\u00a0 Adults who cannot care for themselves must be monitored by their caregivers.</p> <p>The Library honors all Berks County public libraries consortium Library cards (adult and children), but the Yocum Library only issues adult Library cards to community members who have a valid PA ID and proof of current address.</p> <p>The Library's computers are available only to RACC trustees, faculty, staff, students, and alumni. There is a WiFi network in the Library that can be used with a non-RACC patron's own laptop computer to access the Internet.\u00a0 </p> <p>The Library staff reserves the right to remove any patron whose behavior violates the Library\u2019s Standards of Behavior Policy.</p> <p><strong>ACTIVITY ZONES </strong></p> <p>While the Yocum Library staff wants to provide an environment that is friendly and comfortable for our patrons, we must emphasize that the Library is a center for learning.\u00a0 Some people need a quiet place to learn while others learn best through group collaboration.\u00a0 It is also a center for teaching because both teaching and librarian faculty instruct individuals and groups in the use of Library resources and services.\u00a0 In order to create an environment that serves both types of learners while also accommodating the Library\u2019s teaching function, we have divided the Library into two distinct activity zones.\u00a0 Each zone has a different noise level expectation.</p> <p><strong>The Quiet Study Zone</strong> is intended to serve individual students who need to concentrate. \u00a0In this zone NO talking is permitted.\u00a0 Headphones that are able to block all sound transmission must be used when listening to audio on computers or other equipment.\u00a0\u00a0 The 3rd and 4th floors are the Quiet Study Zones in the Library.\u00a0 Nevertheless, some noise is to be expected in this zone during special events on the 4th floor.</p> <p><strong>The Active Learning Zone</strong> is intended for instructional and/or collaborative learning experiences.\u00a0 In this zone moderate-level talking is expected and quiet cell phone conversations are permitted.\u00a0 Headphones that are able to block all sound transmission must be used when listening to audio on computers or other equipment.\u00a0 The 2nd floor is the Active Learning Zone.</p> <p>Patrons who do not conform to the acceptable noise level of the Library zone will be asked to modify their behavior or move to a more appropriate area.\u00a0 Patrons who do not agree to conform to the acceptable noise level of the Library zone or agree to use another area of the Library will be asked to leave the Library.</p> <p>Please contact a Library staff member if you have a concern about noise levels at a specific time.\u00a0 </p> <p><strong>EXPECTED BEHAVIORS</strong></p> <ul> <li>Patrons shall follow all RACC policies and federal, state, or local laws, including, but not limited to, the RACC Student Bill of Rights (RACC students only), RACC Computer Usage Policy which is posted on the Library\u2019s website and near the entrance of the Library, and the Academic Honesty Policy; Federal laws on copyright infringement and peer-to-peer file sharing; and Pennsylvania laws on mutilating and stealing Library materials such as the Pennsylvania Library Theft Act which is posted on the Library\u2019s website and information kiosk at the entrance of the Library.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Library patrons shall respect the rights of all other patrons and staff at all times. Patrons are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that enables patrons and Library staff to accomplish their intended Library tasks in a safe, civil, and orderly atmosphere. Patrons are urged to report disruptive behavior to Library staff.\u00a0 Staff will take appropriate action when patron behavior causes disruption in the delivery of services.\u00a0 </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Patrons display behaviors appropriate to the Activity Zone that they are in.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Patrons must wear appropriate and complete dress, including shirt and footwear, at all times.\u00a0 Clothing and accessories with offensive language, racial comments or slurs, or other inappropriate language, logos and/or pictures are unacceptable dress and if worn, the Library patron will be asked to leave the Library.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Patrons are responsible for their own property and should not leave personal items unattended.\u00a0 Unattended items may be subject to inspection and/or removal.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>If the security gates sound an alarm as a patron exits, the patron must return to the Service Desk to verify that the materials were handled properly by the staff. All briefcases, handbags, backpacks, duffle bags, overcoats, shopping bags, luggage, and other packages may be subject to inspection by Library or Security staff.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Patrons must leave the Library at the designated closing times or upon request from Library staff or RACC Security staff. \u00a0If the Library\u2019s emergency systems are activated, patrons must follow all staff directions and instructions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIORS</strong></p> <p>Unacceptable behaviors are those that, by the assessment of the Library staff, interfere with the use of the Library by other patrons, create a risk of injury to other patrons and/or Library staff, interfere with the work of Library staff, or create a risk of damage to Library property. \u00a0The Library reserves the right to interpret this standard, to apply it, and to change it as necessary. This is not an exhaustive list; unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited, to: </p> <ul> <li>Harassing or discriminatory behavior based on race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other status protected by law.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Any type of behavior that detracts from the teaching/learning process such as running, throwing objects; yelling; climbing on furniture; following patrons or staff throughout the Library; annoying fellow patrons by talking to them while they are trying to read, study or contemplate; abusing, verbally harassing or intimidating patrons or staff; use of profanity, abusive or threatening language; use of threatening gestures or unwanted physical contact.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Intentionally damaging, destroying, or stealing any property that belongs to the Library, a staff member, or a patron.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Possession or consumption of alcohol except at authorized RACC functions.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Possession or consumption of illegal drugs, narcotics, or controlled substances.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Consumption of tobacco products.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Inappropriate sexual behavior including engaging in lewd or lascivious behavior, solicitation, sexual harassment, indecent exposure and/or voyeurism.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Possession of weapons of any kind, except by authorized RACC staff or law enforcement officers.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Roller blading, roller skating, or skate boarding on Library premises. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Bringing animals into the Library except those that are part of a RACC program or are service animals. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Distributing, posting, or placing on Library property any printed materials except through authorized RACC procedures.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Selling or soliciting in the Library unless authorized by the RACC administration such as for RACC clubs.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Entering areas marked \"Library Staff Only\u201d or using Library staff telephones or other staff equipment without permission.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Inappropriately or excessively using the restrooms including bathing, shaving, or clothes washing.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Sleeping in the Library.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Viewing on computer screens images that are not appropriate for a public and open environment and that create a hostile or offensive environment.<br/> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Using emergency exits or setting off fire, elevator, and/or exit door alarms when no emergency exists.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Blocking walkways, exits, or entrances with electrical cords or personal belongings.<strong></strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>SANCTIONS</strong></p> <ul> <li>RACC students, faculty, and staff are liable to the sanctions as defined in existing RACC policies.\u00a0 These sanctions may include warnings, immediate removal from the Library by Security staff, and/or permanent banning from the Library.\u00a0 Appeals may be made following established RACC policies.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Non-RACC patrons who violate The Yocum Library\u2019s Standards of Behavior Policy may receive sanctions that include a warning, immediate removal from the Library by Security staff, permanent banning from the RACC campus, and/or criminal prosecution if the conduct constitutes a violation of local, state or federal law.<br/> </li> </ul> <p align=\"right\">June 2013</p> <p></p> <p></p>", "uid": "0", "title": "The Yocum Library Standards of Behavior Policy", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Yocum/policy_public.aspx", "path": "/Yocum/policy_public.aspx", "folder": "/Yocum"},

{"body": "<p>Commitment to service to its patrons provides the foundation for The Yocum Library's provision of reference services. Reference services are provided to students, staff, and faculty of Reading Area Community College as well as to individuals and institutions who request these services. Although members of the RACC community have priority, reference service is provided as quickly as possible for non-college patrons and institutions.</p> <p>Reference services are provided in person, by telephone, by mail, by fax, or by e-mail. If possible, simple reference questions received by telephone are answered while the patron is on the line. However, for questions requiring more in-depth research, the library staff will contact the patron as soon as possible. Results may also be sent directly to the patron by mail, by fax, or by e-mail. More complex searches may require the recommendation that the patron visit the library in person. </p> <p>The Yocum Library reserves the right to refuse requests which violate local, state, or federal law, such as, but not limited to, requests which are violations of copyright, pornography, sexual harassment, or privacy laws. The library staff is not accountable for the validity of published information or for uses to which information may be put by patrons. Moreover, the library staff does not interpret the law, diagnose medical problems, or recommend materials or companies for purchase or hire. The library staff does not provide computer program instruction.</p> <p>If the resources of The Yocum Library cannot satisfy the patron's request, the library staff will contact other libraries or resource centers to attempt to discover a source. If the patron needs to visit another facility to acquire the needed information, the library staff will provide guidance in the use of the recommended facility.</p> <p>The level of the reference request determines which library staff member should provide service. All library staff members answer directional questions: location of library features - circulation desk, reference desk, computer catalogs, Internet workstations, photocopiers, displays, collections, offices, study rooms, testing center, bathrooms, etc. Student staff members answer directional questions only.</p> <p>In addition to directional questions, library assistants assist patrons in the basic use of computer catalogs, Internet workstations, audio-visual equipment, photocopiers, retrieval of library materials, and explanations of library policies and procedures.</p> <p>In addition to the above services library paraprofessionals provide basic reference services to patrons. They conduct introductory reference interviews and determine the level of the reference request. They provide reference services or refer the patron to the reference librarian if they determine that more help is required. They assist the patron in computer catalog features, Internet search strategies, and basic reference sources. They provide instruction in basic library search techniques.</p> <p>Reference librarians provide the highest level of reference service. Patrons should interface with the reference librarian before pursuing other sources including interlibrary loan. They recommend patrons to other facilities for further research and instruct patrons in the effective use of those facilities. They provide in-depth library instruction. If a reference librarian is not available, the patron can schedule a meeting in person or by telephone.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "The Yocum Library Reference Policies\r\n", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Yocum/policy_ref.aspx", "path": "/Yocum/policy_ref.aspx", "folder": "/Yocum"},

{"body": "<img alt=\"RACC Launches Psi Beta Chapter\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"200\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/News/Features/images/PSI_Beta.jpg\" width=\"300\"/> <p>Reading Area Community College inducted eight students into its newly-approved chapter of Psi Beta, a national honor society for psychology students at two-year colleges, during a special ceremony on May 10 at the College.</p> <p>Andrew Baumeister first conceived the idea of a RACC chapter of Psi Beta during the 2012-13 academic year. He talked about the idea with Vince Orlando, a fellow psychology major, while the two were work-study students in the Advantage Program office. Although Andrew graduated last May, Vince picked up and ran with the cause, with the help and advising of Dr. David Brant.</p> <p>There were seven meetings during this academic year where students who were interested in the club elected officers and created a constitution and by-laws for Student Government Association to approve them as a sanctioned campus activity.</p> <p>\"Every officer worked relentlessly to have the club sanctioned on RACC campus,\" said Melissa Lindbom, who is secretary of RACC's chapter of Psi Beta. \"Though it was a struggle, we constantly worked together in order to achieve our goal. I can't thank them enough for their diligence and determination.\"</p> <p>Kim Beadencup, the group's vice-president, graduated in December but returned for a few extra classes in the spring semester. \"I felt in my heart that I needed to come back one more semester because I felt like I left unfinished business behind. I know that I will enjoy the benefits of being a PSI Beta member. However,\u00a0my greater joy is the privilege I was given to have a part in leaving a legacy behind at RACC,\" said Kim.</p> <p>Dr. Brant, who has been a full-time faculty member at RACC since 2001, has also been a clinician for more than 30 years. He also runs a limited private practice in Berks County.</p> <p>\"Dr. Brant was the glue that held the officers together,\" said Melissa. \"His passion for psychology and education has been a true inspiration. I can only hope that Psi Beta will become as much of a positive aspect of RACC as possible. We all worked hard so that future RACC students are provided with the opportunity to join Psi Beta and prosper within it.\"</p> <p>Service opportunities, networking and scholarships are the major benefits for students who join RACC's chapter of Psi Beta. Already during meetings this year, guest speakers have included Berks Connection Pre-Trial Services and alumni Chris O'Reilly who is the Relapse Unit Clinical Supervisor at Caron Treatment Centers. The club recently volunteered at a fundraiser breakfast for Berks Connection, a non-profit agency that assists individuals and families involved in the Berks County criminal and juvenile justice systems. Looking ahead for the coming year, Dr. Brant is coordinating RACC student involvement in the PA Psychological Association conference that will be in Harrisburg.</p> <p>Rachel Lee, the current club treasurer, is one of those students who will be able to reap the Psi Beta rewards for the upcoming year. A psychology major, Rachel has been involved with the club since the first meeting when there were just four students. She was attracted to the idea of creating something permanent at RACC that would benefit all psychology students across time.</p> <p>\"Today, it truly amazes me to see how many students are talking about Psi Beta, attending the meetings, and are listening to the speakers we bring in. I can't wait for next year,\" Rachel said.</p> <p>Interested students do not have to be psychology majors, but the chapter does require a 3.25 overall GPA and a 3.5 GPA in psychology classes.</p> <p>Vince, who\u00a0 also graduated this year, feels a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. \"This experience will go down in history at RACC. I do not believe that it will ever be forgotten by the students and advisors who worked so hard to make this dream a reality.\"</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "RACC Launches Psi Beta Chapter", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/PSI_Beta.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/PSI_Beta.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

{"body": "<p><img alt=\"tech\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"202\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/News/Features/../../images/scroller/tech.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><strong>Reading</strong> - Reading Area Community College (RACC) and Berks Career and Technology Center (BCTC) signed an agreement on Monday, Nov. 2, creating a Technical Academy that provides a technical career pathway opportunity for students in a high demand occupation. Economic revitalization of Berks County depends on more young people acquiring the advanced technical training that good jobs require. The area's eight economic development agencies' position paper, Ride to Prosperity clearly identifies the need to increase educational attainment levels especially in those skills required for employment in high demand occupations as a local challenge.</p> <p> The goal of this BCTC and RACC educational partnership, which has strong local industry support, is to increase the number of high school students preparing for the field of Engineering Technology in a way that allows for multiple exit points each with awarding students a specific employment credential and set of defined skills. </p> <p>The program, the first in a new model entitled The Technical Academy, includes a sequence of courses leading to industry recognized certificates, an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree from RACC, and /or a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in the \"high priority\" field of Engineering Technology (ET). </p> <p>This partnership targets college-bound students in 9th and 10th grade with participants actually beginning the program in 10th or 11th grade at the BCTC. It is intended to be highly selective and will require an overall 3.00 GPA, specific math and reading proficiency as measured on the PSSA tests, and successful completion of a structured and progressively advanced math and science sequence. </p> <p>High school students successfully completing up to five (5) Technical Academy courses and passing a national industry competency examination at the BCTC will earn up to 15 transcripted credits toward a RACC Associate Degree. The model then allows these high school students to move to the RACC campus to complete the remaining 100 level technical courses that make up the AAS degree in MET by the end of their senior year in high school. This would include 3 courses which equates to an additional 12 RACC credits. Students at this point will also earn a certificate recognizing their technical competence and skills. </p> <p>Students graduating from BCTC's Technical Academy will be encouraged to continue in the Mechatronics Engineering Technology (MET) degree program at RACC where they can also earn advanced certificates. Students completing the AAS degree at RACC will be encouraged to continue their education by transferring to a four year degree granting institution or to enter the workforce. Transfer options into a Bachelor's Degree program from RACC's AAS in MET include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Penn State Berks</strong> - BS in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology. Students will be awarded 56 credits toward this degree for completion of the AAS.</li> <li> <strong>Purdue Calumet</strong> - BS in Mechatronics Engineering Technology. Students will be awarded 65 credits toward this degree for completion of the AAS. </li> <li> <strong>California State University of PA</strong> - BS in Industrial Technology. Students will be awarded 75 credits toward this degree for completion of the AAS. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Cost Savings for Students and Their Families</strong> - The five (5) courses that students complete on the BCTC campus will be provided at no cost with credit issued by RACC through a formal articulation agreement.

Professor Kline gave them the option of competing in the Business Idea Challenge and counting that as their project.</p> <p>Gary, who had solar panels installed on his house several years ago, already had an idea. \"After a snowstorm, the next day it's usually sunny, but my panels are covered with snow,\" he began. \"The only way to clean them is to get on the roof with all of that snow and ice. So, I had an idea about a machine that would remove the snow, and clean pollen and dirt.\"</p> <p>Since there is nothing like that currently on the market, Gary talked with some engineers in his family about the feasibility of such an idea, and they thought it could work.</p> <p>Gary and Lindsey have had several classes together as Business Management majors, so he started by pitching the idea to her, and then they recruited Courtney to join their team.</p> <p>The first stage of the competition required the group to prepare a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation that included financial information for their business, marketing strategy, cost analysis, target market and organizational structure of their company. </p> <p>\"I was the more creative group member, so I took the initiative to create the PowerPoint and organize the information,\" Courtney said. \"I have never done any contests in the business field before; however, I was very involved in art contests/shows in the past.\"</p> <p>Eighteen entries were received, with the top five advancing to the final round. For the finals, the group had to whittle their PowerPoint down to an 8-minute presentation, and then go through a 7-minute question-and-answer period. Gary compared it to the popular television show Shark Tank.</p> <p>Lindsey, who handled the introduction and conclusion, said she was nervous. \"I get stressed out when I have to do public speaking,\" she said. \"But, I knew our idea was good.\"</p> <p>Lindsey is a 2010 graduate of Muhlenberg and will graduate in May 2014. She would like to attend a photography school after she finishes at RACC. Courtney, who went to Governor Mifflin, is also on pace to graduate next May with a degree in accounting.</p> <p>Gary, who spent 30 years working in Information Technology before his job was sent overseas, will graduate in December.

{"body": "<h3>What is an honors contract? </h3> <p>An honors contract is an instructional agreement whereby a student can earn honors credit through enrichment of a standard, non-honors course (3-credit minimum).\u00a0 The student and faculty member work together to identify the specific requirements for the honors contract.\u00a0 If the course and additional requirements are successfully completed, an Honors designation will appear after the course title on the student's academic record. </p> <h3>The following guidelines may be helpful in planning an honors contract: </h3> <p>The honors contract option is intended to provide intellectual challenge and growth for students with high ability and a strong desire to learn.\u00a0 An honors contract should not necessarily involve a greater quantity of work than in a standard course but rather work that is qualitatively different.\u00a0 Typically, honors work involves exploratory learning, collaborative projects, interdisciplinary themes, primary research, practical applications of concepts and skills.\u00a0 Thus, writing a longer paper or an extra paper usually would not suffice by itself for an honors contract.\u00a0 Writing a longer paper that requires more in-depth primary research might qualify.\u00a0 Similarly, doing extra problems in a math course would not suffice, but doing more sophisticated problems or developing a computer program to solve problems might be appropriate. </p> <p>Students and faculty are encouraged to think creatively in planning honors contracts.\u00a0 For example, in some cases work on campus or in the community might satisfy the honors contract requirement.\u00a0 Helping faculty do research or develop a new course, preparing science exhibits, organizing a community awareness campaign, solving a civic problem - activities such as these may be excellent for honors contracts.</p> <p>All activities should relate clearly to the course in which the student is enrolled. </p> <p>Usually, the student will still complete all regular course activities.\u00a0 If the contract activities are to replace the standard ones, this should be explained on the proposal form.\u00a0 Successful completion of the agreement is recognized by the honors course designation on the student's academic record.\u00a0 Failure to complete the agreement should not, in itself, lower a student's grade as long as other course work is satisfactory. </p> <h3>Who is eligible for an honors contract option? </h3> <p>Any student who meets the <a href=\"eligible.aspx\">eligibility requirements</a> for taking honors courses may submit a contract proposal. </p> <h3>Applying and receiving credit for an honors contract: </h3> <p>A completed proposal should be submitted to <a href=\"mailto:pblakely@racc.edu\">Dr. Pamela A.R. Blakely</a>, Honors Program Coordinator, early in the term and will not be accepted after the fourth week of the term.\u00a0 The student has full responsibility for seeking the necessary approvals identified on the proposal form. </p> <p>The student must request the instructor's agreement to an honors contract.\u00a0 Faculty members are free to decline such proposals, so students are encouraged to seek faculty support prior to registration.\u00a0 Either the student or the faculty member may request the honors committee's approval of the proposal.\u00a0 However, the student is responsible for ensuring that the form is submitted to the Honors Program office (Y-105) by the deadline. </p> <p>The original contract will be placed in the student's permanent file in the Records Office (B107).\u00a0 At the end of the term, the faculty member will certify that the terms of the contract have been satisfactorily completed by signing the bottom portion of the proposal.\u00a0 The registrar will then enter the \"Honors\" designation after the course title on the student's transcript.\u00a0 Honors options are subject to the standard College policies on incompletes.</p> <p> <strong>For more information:</strong> Contact <a href=\"mailto:pblakely@racc.edu\">Dr. Pamela A.R.

{"body": "<p><strong>What is an independent study?</strong></p> <p>Independent Study is an instructional arrangement whereby a student can earn 1-4 honors credits through activity or study not available through the College's standard courses.\u00a0 Such activities are often cross-disciplinary in nature and are typically related to one's major or career goals.</p> <p>The student and a faculty member work together to develop a proposal outlining the goals, time frames, and methodology involved.\u00a0 Upon successful completion of the proposed work, the student's academic record will indicate a specified number of honors credits have been earned through independent study.\u00a0 In addition, a summary of project achievements, written by the faculty mentor, will be included in the student's record.</p> <p><strong>The following guidelines may be helpful in planning independent study projects: </strong></p> <p>The independent study option is intended to provide intellectual challenge and growth for students with high ability, a compelling interest in a particular discipline or area, and the capacity to work independently.\u00a0 A standard course involves forty hours of class instruction and often two or more hours of homework for each hour of class time.\u00a0 The time invested in an independent study project should be similar to that for a course of comparable credit.</p> <p>Students and faculty are encouraged to think creatively in planning independent study projects, which typically emphasize the importance of research, creative works, and/or three-dimensional products.\u00a0 Some examples of appropriate activities include:\u00a0 writing short stories, building a robot, presenting a musical recital, conducting an experiment, designing and implementing an educational program, producing a television documentary, conducting in-depth primary research.</p> <p><strong>Who is eligible for the independent study option? </strong></p> <p>Any student who meets the <a href=\"eligible.aspx\">eligibility requirements</a> for taking honors courses may submit an independent study proposal. </p> <p><strong>Applying and receiving credit for an honors independent study: </strong></p> <p>A completed proposal should be submitted to <a href=\"mailto:pblakely@racc.edu\">Dr. Pamela A.R. Blakely</a>, Honors Program Coordinator, no later than the final day of the drop/add period for a given term. The student has full responsibility for seeking the necessary approvals identified on the proposal form.</p> <p>The student must request the instructor's agreement to an independent study proposal.\u00a0 Faculty members are free to decline such proposals, so students are encouraged to seek faculty support prior to registration.\u00a0 Either the student or the faculty member may request the honors committee's approval of the proposal.\u00a0 However, the student is responsible for ensuring that the form is submitted to the Honors Program office (Y105) by the deadline.</p> <p>The original contract will be placed in the student's permanent file in the Records Office (B107).\u00a0 At the end of the term, the faculty member will certify that the terms of the contract have been satisfactorily completed by signing the bottom portion of the proposal.\u00a0 The registrar will then enter the \"Honors\" designation after the course title on the student's transcript.\u00a0 Independent study options are subject to the standard College policies on incompletes. </p> <p> <strong>For more information:</strong> Contact <a href=\"mailto:pblakely@racc.edu\">Dr. Pamela A.R.

It consists of approximately 200 string music titles, 600 complete orchestra titles, 100 chamber music titles, 100 salon music titles, 150 German published titles, 300 dance band music titles, and 1300 piano music titles. In addition, the collection includes many hand-written music scores written by Berks County composers and arrangers. The age of the collection ranges from the late 1800s to the 1980s.</p> <p>In 2002 the college received a federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant from the Pennsylvania Office of Commonwealth Libraries which funded the cataloging of the collection, so that researchers could better access the collection.</p><br/><br/> <hr/><br/> <h2>About Wes Fisher</h2> <p><img alt=\"Wes Fisher\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"297\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/Yocum/WesFisher/images-main/WF-picture.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>Wesley \u201cWes\u201d Fisher was born in 1913. As a youth he began playing the violin and bass violin. While attending Reading High School, he was student director of the concert band, organized a string ensemble, and joined the Reading Symphony Orchestra as a bassist. Mr Fisher was the bassist for the Reading Symphony Orchestra for over fifty years as well as playing with the Lancaster Symphony, Harrisburg Symphony, Valley Forge Symphony, Pottstown Symphony, and Allentown Symphony orchestras.</p> <p>He also organized and conducted the Reading Pops Orchestra. During his long professional musical career accomplishments, Mr. Fisher served the local community in many ways as a member of boards, committees, and festivals. For many years he was involved with the \u201cMusic in the Schools\u201d program, and, in fact, helped broaden its scope in both musical content and school locations. During his long musical career, Wes Fisher collected music scores from a variety of sources and created a significant collection, which he generously donated to Reading Area Community College in the 1990s.</p> <hr/><br/> <h2>Wes Fisher Project</h2> <p>The generous gift by Wes Fisher of his music score collection was a welcome addition to the collection of The Yocum Library of Reading Area Community College. Its size and format presented some challenges in organizing and accessing the collection. <img alt=\"Photo of Piano Music &quot;Love's Victory&quot;\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"265\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/Yocum/WesFisher/images-main/p1388-0.jpg\" width=\"210\"/>\u00a0 </p> <p>The library staff first worked on preserving the collection by removing foreign materials which were threatening to damage the items (rusting paper clips, melting rubber bands, etc.) and transferring the scores to archival folders. The Foundation for Reading Area Community College helped to fund the purchase of many cabinets to store these music folders. The College then had the collection inventoried and appraised. At this point, the only access to the collection was by using Wes Fisher\u2019s original numbering system and his notebooks.</p> <p>A grant application was submitted to the Pennsylvania Office of Commonwealth Libraries to fund the cataloging of the Wes Fisher Music Score Collection. In 2002 the College was notified that the project would be funded with federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) funds administered through the Office of Commonwealth Libraries. With this grant, the bulk of the collection was cataloged and included in the catalog of The Yocum Library, which is a catalog shared by many of the libraries in Berks County, including the Berks County public libraries and Alvernia College. In addition, information about the collection was included on the web site of the College.</p> <p>Project staff members included Jose-Alby Fabiani, James Corbit, Bridget Heckman Swoyer, Mary Ellen G. Heckman, Patricia Nouhra, Ryan Sittler, Kim R. Stahler, and Lori Zonca. Linda Lawrence, The Yocum Library\u2019s Technical Services Librarian, provided invaluable cataloging training and assistance for the project. The College\u2019s Web site staff, David Richards and Ronald Kelly, and project staff member, Jose-Alby Fabiani, collaborated to create the project\u2019s web site.</p> <hr/><br/> <p>For further information about the collection contact:<br/> Mary Ellen G.

{"body": "<p> <strong>Where is the Career Center located, and what are the hours of operation?</strong><br/> We are located in Berks Hall 220, and the hours of operation are as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Mondays: 8:00am to 5:00pm </li> <li>Tuesdays: 8:00am to 7:30pm </li> <li>Wednesdays 8:00am to 7:30pm </li> <li>Thursdays: 8:00am to 5:00pm </li> <li>Fridays: 8:00am to 4:00pm </li> </ul> <p><strong>Who is eligible for the services of the Career Center? </strong><br/> Our services are free to RACC\u2019s current students and alumni.</p> <p><strong>What services does the Career Center offer? </strong><br/> We offer the following: individual career counseling, workshops, career/job fairs, information about job openings, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 critiquing, interviewing practice, on-campus recruiters, job search strategies, and a career library.</p> <p><strong>What is career counseling, and who benefits from it? </strong><br/> Career counseling involves learning about yourself, discovering occupations, and understanding how to use tools and resources that can help you find the best occupations for your personality and interests. It uses counseling sessions, career assessments, activities, and reading materials to help you find your career focus. Career counseling can be useful for individuals who do not know what career field they would like to enter, are having trouble deciding on a college major or program, want to confirm a career choice they have already made or are making a career change.</p> <p><strong>What would I find in the Career Center library? </strong><br/> You will find occupational resources regarding majors and careers, specific information about a variety of occupations and fields, \u201chot\u201d jobs, and the Occupational Outlook Handbook. We have r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter writing, interviewing, and job search resources, as well as, handouts on a multitude of career-elated topics.</p> <p><strong>When do I need to prepare a r\u00e9sum\u00e9? </strong><br/> Everyone should have a working r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in order to be prepared for part-time employment, internships, Co-op\u2019s, work study positions, and other opportunities that may arise throughout your college career. It is never too early to create a r\u00e9sum\u00e9!</p> <p><strong>What is a cover letter and why do I need one? </strong><br/> A cover letter is usually submitted with your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to acquaint the employer with your skills and experience, and prompt the employer to arrange an interview. It gives you an opportunity to talk more in-depth about the content of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. </p> <p><strong>How do I decide on a career path? </strong><br/> The first step is assessing your individual interests, skills, and values. The second step is gathering information about majors and occupations related to majors. The third step is generating alternatives. The fourth step is making a decision. Many students find it helpful to talk to a counselor throughout this decision making process. The Career Center can help with every step along the way.</p> <p><strong>How do I research occupations? </strong><br/> There are vast amounts of information regarding occupations. The Career Center has a library which houses various books about occupations. There are also many useful websites for exploring the world of work. A Career Specialist can help guide your research. </p> <p><strong>How do I search for jobs? </strong><br/> The job search is a job in and of itself. First, you should tell EVERYONE you know that you are seeking employment and ask everyone you know for job leads. Search the \u201cwant-ads\u201d in local newspapers. There are also many online resources for job hunting. RACC is affiliated with College Central Network, which lists current, local job opportunities. Speak with a Career Specialist to learn about additional online resources. The Career Center is NOT a placement service; however other employment agencies are available in the area. Sometimes simply sending your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to companies/organizations that are of interest to you can lead to a job opportunity. </p> <p><strong>How do I prepare for an interview? </strong><br/> First and foremost, you need to know yourself and be able to articulate what you have to offer. Next, you need to research the employer/position. Finally, you should practice utilizing interviewing skills prior to your interview. You may want to meet with a Career Specialist to learn about interviewing skills and to practice.</p> <p><strong>What are informational interviews? </strong><br/> Informational interviews take place between you and a worker in an occupation that is of interest to you in order to gain specific information about an occupation. Talk to a Career Specialist to learn more about how to prepare for these interviews and find individuals to interview. </p> <p><strong>What is a Co-op? </strong><br/> Co-op, or cooperative education, is a partnership between the college and the employer that provides students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge they have gained in the classroom to the reality of the workplace while obtaining (up to three) credits. Students are eligible for a co-op after completion of 27 credits or three terms. Co-op\u2019s are required in some courses of study and optional in others. You can find more information in the Career Center.</p> <p><strong>What is a work-study job and how do I get one?</strong><br/> A work-study job is an on campus position that is funded through Financial Aid. Students who are full-time and PA residents may apply for positions through the Financial Aid office. A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is required as part of the application. For more information visit the financial aid office or the work study <a href=\"../FinancialAid/Workstudy/job_opp.aspx\">webpage.</a></p> <p><strong>I am an older student returning to school. How can the Career Center help me? </strong><br/> A career counselor can help you to clarify your current needs and interests and set goals based on a realistic assessment of your particular situation. We will help you explore your career options in order to choose an academic program as well as determine your career plans. Our Career Specialist also understands your special concerns and needs of returning students and help you with this transition. </p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/CareerServices/faq.aspx", "path": "/CareerServices/faq.aspx", "folder": "/CareerServices"},

The ADA defines service animals as:</p> <p>\"\u2026dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties.\" <strong>Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person\u2019s disability</strong>.</p> <p>Pennsylvania anti-discrimination statutes (P.L. 208, Act 72) guarantee a blind person the legal right to be accompanied by a guide dog in all accommodations which are made available for public use. The statutes further guarantee equal housing accommodation to guide dog users in both the rental and purchase of housing.</p> <p>Dogs in training are not considered service animals. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of \"assistance animal\" under the Fair Housing Act.</p> <h2>Definitions--Types of Service Dogs and Terms</h2> <p><strong>Guide dog</strong>: A dog that is carefully trained to serve as a travel tool by individuals with severe visual impairments or who are blind. </p> <p><strong>Hearing dog</strong>: A dog that has been trained to alert a person with significant hearing loss or who is deaf to a sound (e.g. a knock on the door, a fire alarm, the phone ringing). </p> <p><strong>Service dog (assistance dog)</strong>: A dog that has been trained to assist a person who has mobility or health impairment. The duties the dog may perform include: carrying, fetching, opening doors, ringing doorbells, activating elevator buttons, steadying a person while walking, assisting a person to get up after a fall, etc.</p> <p><strong>Sig dog</strong>: A dog trained to assist a person with autism. The dog alerts the partner to distracting repetitive movements common among those with autism, allowing the person to stop the movement. A person with autism may have deficits in sensory input and may need the same support services from a dog that one might provide for a person who is blind or deaf. </p> <p><strong>Seizure response dog</strong>: A dog trained to assist a person with a seizure disorder. The method in which the dog serves the person depends on the individual\u2019s needs. The dog may stand guard over the person during a seizure or the dog may go for help. Some dogs learn to predict a seizure and warn the person in advance. </p> <p><strong>Partner/handler</strong>: A person with a service animal. A person with a disability using a service animal is called a partner; a person without a disability is called a handler. </p> <p><strong>Service Animal</strong>: A dog individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability. </p> <p><strong>Team</strong>: A person with a disability, or partner and the service animal. The two work as a team in accomplishing the tasks of everyday living. </p> <p><strong>Therapy animal</strong>: A therapy animal may soothe anxiety in some individuals, but does not assist an individual with a disability in the activities of daily living. Therapy animals are not protected by laws for service animals under the ADA. </p> <h2>Policy and Procedures</h2> <p>Inquiries: When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person\u2019s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.</p> <p><strong>Control Requirements</strong>: Service animals must be harnessed, leashed or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal\u2019s work or the individual\u2019s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls. The partner must be in full control of the animal at all times. The animal must be as unobtrusive as possible. </p> <p><strong>Exclusion for behavior</strong>: A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal\u2019s presence.</p> <p><strong>Consequences for behavior</strong>: When a service animal is determined to be out of control, the infraction will be treated on an individual basis through the Disability Services Office. If the animal poses a threat to the safety of others, Security and, if necessary, local police will become a part of the collaborative team to determine the outcome of the behavior. </p> <p><strong>Exclusion \u2013 Allergies/Fear</strong>: Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.</p> <h2>Responsibilities for Individuals with Disabilities using Service Animals on Campus</h2> <p>Individuals with disabilities using service animals on campus are responsible for ensuring that the animal is properly treated by the handler and by others and behaves and responds appropriately at all times in public and the team must adhere to the same socially accepted standards as any individual in the university community. </p> <p><strong>Clean up rule</strong>: The partner must follow local ordinances in cleaning up after the animal defecates. Individuals who physically cannot clean up after their own service animal due to extenuating circumstances may not be required to personally pick up and dispose of feces; however partners are required to make other arrangements for the prompt disposal of waste.</p> <h2>Visitors with Service Animals</h2> <p>All visitors to campus with service animals must adhere to the same guidelines as members of the campus community.</p> <h2>Areas Off Limits To Service Animals</h2> <p>There are certain instances when it may be considered unsafe for the animals to be in such places as medical facilities, laboratories, mechanical rooms or any other place where the safety of the animal or its partner may be threatened. Each location\u2019s safety will be evaluated by a group of individuals including: the Disability Services Office, the laboratory director or professor, and other staff who can assess and manage risks on campus. When it is determined unsafe for the team to be in one of these areas, reasonable accommodations will be provided to assure the student equal access to the activity. </p> <h2>Emergency Situations</h2> <p>In the event of an emergency, the responding team should be trained to recognize service animals and to be aware that the animal may be trying to communicate the need for assistance. The animal may become disoriented from the smell of smoke in a fire or laboratory emergency, from sirens or wind noise, or from shaking and moving ground. The partner and/or animal may be confused in a stressful situation. The responding team should be aware that the animal is trying to protect and, in its confusion, is not to be considered harmful and every effort should be made to keep the animal with its partner. </p> <h2>Pets</h2> <p>Consistent with this policy, non-service animals (i.e., companion or therapy pets) are not permitted in classrooms, academic activities, faculty offices, administrative offices or any college building, except when the non-service animal is being used for academic demonstration or other college-related purposes. </p> <h3>\u00a0</h3> <p>\u00a0</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Service Animal Guidelines", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/StudentLife/Services/DisabilityServices/service_animals.aspx", "path": "/StudentLife/Services/DisabilityServices/service_animals.aspx", "folder": "/StudentLife/Services/DisabilityServices"},

Chapter requirements for admission as a provisional member shall be academic excellence as defined by a 3.6 GPA with six or more credits of associate degree coursework taken at RACC. Provisional members have two terms to bring their provisional membership status up to general membership status. It is the responsibility of the student seeking provisional membership to petition, in writing, the chapter president. </p> <p> In order to become a provisional member, a student must have completed the required hours of associate degree coursework at RACC, adhere to the school conduct code, and possess recognized qualities of citizenship.

My name is <strong>Tana Acosta</strong>, and I am a Secondary Education major here at RACC. I\u2019m hoping to transfer to a four-year university to pursue dual majors in English and Music Education. Aside from being an Ambassador, I participate in the RACCy Olympics, RACC\u2019s Leadership and Advantage Programs, I am a member of Phi Theta Kappa, and I perform on campus at certain events. Outside of RACC, I am a singer/songwriter, and I love creating music. I also love watching movies, playing video games, and hanging out with my friends. Being an Ambassador has had such an amazing impact on me. I came to RACC knowing no one, and now I know almost everyone there is to know on campus. I will be graduating in May of 2016, but until then, I plan to continue helping new students feel at home here at RACC just like I do.</p> </div> <div class=\"ravenAmb\"><img alt=\"Rachel Chlebowski\" height=\"200\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/Ravens/images/RachelChlebowski.jpg\" style=\"float: left; padding: 0 20px 0\" width=\"150\"/> <p>Bonjour!

Hopefully, one day, I\u2019ll be sipping a pi\u00f1a colada on a tropical beach writing my next best-seller.

My activities outside of college revolve around clay-crafting, writing, reading, researching Irish history and archery.

{"body": "<h2>Help Prevent Financial Aid/Scholarship Fraud</h2> <p>Every year, millions of high school graduates seek creative ways to finance the markedly rising costs of a college education. In the process, they sometimes fall prey to scholarship and financial aid scams. On Nov. 5, 2000, Congress passed the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 2000 (CSFPA). The CSFPA enhances protection against fraud in student financial assistance by establishing stricter sentencing guidelines for criminal financial aid fraud. It also charged the Department, working in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), with implementing national awareness activities, including a scholarship fraud awareness site on the ED web site.</p> <p>According to the FTC, perpetrators of financial aid fraud often use these telltale lines.</p> <ul> <li>The scholarship is guaranteed or your money back!</li> <li>You can't get this information anywhere else.</li> <li>I just need your credit card or bank account number to hold this scholarship.</li> <li>We'll do all the work!</li> <li>The scholarship will cost some money.</li> <li>You've been selected by a \"national foundation\" to receive a scholarship, or \"you're a finalist\" in a contest you never entered.</li></ul> <p>To file a complaint, or for free information, students or parents should call: 1-800-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) or visit: <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/scholarshipscams\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ftc.gov/scholarshipscams</a></p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Financial Aid and Scholarship Fraud", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/FinancialAid/fraud.aspx", "path": "/FinancialAid/fraud.aspx", "folder": "/FinancialAid"},

I talked myself out of going to college with the excuse that my family didn't have the money. The real truth was I didn't know what I wanted to do and I didn't have the confidence that I was smart enough to go to college. After working at a low-skill and low-paying job, I began to think that I needed more than a high school diploma. Once I learned there was financial aid to pay for college and that it wasn't necessary to know exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, I started going to Penn State University.</p> <p>I was the first in my family to go to college and once I started I was hooked. I've been going to colleges and universities for over 20 years and I finally have a Doctorate! Will I stop? Heck NO! I'm already looking for the next class to take.

Now she is working to make that a reality by bringing Girls on the Run, an international organization, to Berks County. </p><p>\"Girls on the Run is a 12-week program to empower young girls- in grades 3 through 8- to believe in themselves, be fit and healthy, and develop the skills to resist the temptations of peer pressure and make wiser decisions,\"; said Kim, who is a graduate of RACC and now works as an Administrative Assistant at the College.</p> <p>Girls on the Run, which functions like an after-school program, creatively incorporates running with lessons about self-esteem, peer pressure, team-building, and making positive contributions to the community.\u00a0 The program led by certified volunteer coaches also includes a community service project chosen by the girls and culminates with a 5K race.</p> <p>Kim first heard about the program from her former running partner and quickly discovered local chapters in Lancaster, Montgomery and Lehigh counties, but nothing in Berks.\u00a0 She is now applying to create an officially sanctioned council, which would allow her to launch Girls on the Run here in Berks. \"As part of the application process, we need to develop a business plan, submit a proposed budget and put together our steering committee,\" she said.</p> <p>Kim said she is using the skills she learned at RACC to try to make this dream a reality. \"I served as SGA President when I was here, so I'm using a lot of those leadership skills,\" Kim said, \"and I received so much support from instructors and staff that it gave me the confidence to overcome my shyness and be successful.\"</p> <p>Kim earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Temple University and has spent the last 12 years working at RACC while also laying the groundwork to successfully build Girls on the Run. \"I feel like I was meant to come back here and bring Girls on the Run to Berks County,\" she added. </p> <p> Right now, Kim is working hard to raise awareness about Girls on the Run. You can find them on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/#!/gotrberks\">Girls on the Run Berks</a>, and Y102 morning radio host Jackie Hoffman is also promoting the program.</p> <p>Girls on the Run Berks will make its first appearance at the Annual RACC 5KRun or Walk on Sunday, Apr. 15.

Now imagine their faces \u2013 pure joy. That's exactly what students from Dr. John Morgan's philosophy class brought to the RACC Education Laboratory Center this spring.</p> <p>The RACC Readers was first launched in the spring of 2011 when college students visited the Tyson Schoener Elementary School.</p> <p>\"We wanted to bring it closer to home,\" said Tony Gonzales, who is graduating in May with an associate in science degree. \"As students, we often don't realize that the ELC is down there, so we wanted to take this project to a part of campus that we never interact with.\"</p> <p>Initially, the group planned to read to the children from the ELC in RACC's Meditation Garden and then plant the flowers there as this year's improvement to the garden. However, weather and other factors caused the students to switch gears and shift the effort indoors.</p> <p>\"We brought the flowers inside for the kids to plant and take home and they were so happy to see the colors, experience the smells and draw on the cup,\" Tony said. \"It also gave us a chance to see how they view things.\"</p> <p>After the planting, students gathered with the children for circle time and shared stories with them. Tony shared the story of the Farmer and the Mousetrap, thinking the kids would understand the moral in the story. But, he quickly learned that Nichole Russo's reading of Rainbow Fish book got a much more enthusiastic review. \"They were so excited to see all the pictures,\" Nichole said.</p> <p>As for how the day tied into what they learned in philosophy this semester, Nichole found a great connection. \"Philosophy is all about asking questions and that's what kids do all the time. They are like little natural philosophers, they don't have to work at it,\" she said.</p> <p>After their day at the ELC, the students compiled a report on the experience and included recommendations for future classes wishing to keep the RACC Readers going. Nichole said, \"In the future, it would be great if a class could do multiple sessions with the kids and make it happen a few times during the semester.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "RACC Readers Return, Spend Time at RACC Daycare", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/readers.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/readers.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

We left at 5 a.m. arriving shortly after 8 a.m. We walked to the NY Stock Exchange passing Trinity Church and Alexander Hamilton's grave along the way. Some of the students viewed the inside of this historical church.</p> <p>We were welcomed into the Exchange by my friends who run the Teachers' Workshop over the summer and shown to the Members' Gallery where we watched the Opening Bell ceremonies. Opening Bell was rung by an organization of CEO's who have formed an organization called fixthedebt.org. We then were escorted to the floor of the Exchange where the students spoke with \"market specialists\" who explained their functions as stock market traders. </p> <p>After the Exchange, we visited the Museum of American Finance, followed by lunch, a visit to the Federal Reserve exhibits and gold vault, and, for those who chose to, the 9/11 Memorial. All were aboard the bus and ready to make the trip home just before 6 p.m. It was a very successful adventure. Mark Chester, JoAnn Rawley and I seem to make a very good team. I am grateful for their assistance.</p> <p>As I write this, it is hard to believe that the very spots we stood upon in Battery Park became flooded Monday night, especially since we walked right past the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel which has been shown numerous times on the news as being completely filled with water. </p>", "uid": "0", "title": "The Buck Stops Here", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/ny_finance.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/ny_finance.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

She earned an associate degree in Business Administration in 1985 and in 1999 earned a bachelor's degree in Business from Alvernia.</p> <p>Sue has worked at RACC since 1984 in various positions and now oversees the Student Activities Office, which includes the Student Government Association, Leadership Program and five sanctioned clubs. Sue, along with her devoted students, also plan campus speakers, student picnics and other events throughout the year.</p> <h3 style=\"clear:both\">How does it feel to come back and work at your alma mater?</h3> <p>It was exciting to think that I might make a difference for another student to go for their dreams through working in Student Services. I started as a records clerk and moved around a lot as I gained experience and education through the years.</p> <h3>What are some of the benefits of your role as Student Activities Coordinator?</h3> <p>My role allows me to be creative and work with excellent faculty and staff members to offer a terrific leadership program, as well as working with some of the best and brightest of students in offering a wide variety of quality programming for the entire student body. It also allows me to get involved with the students in community service, which is very important to me.</p> <h3>What are the biggest changes you have seen in student life from your time as a student to now? </h3> <p>Wow, it's been 34 years since I first attended RACC. There were a lot of activities for students but it wasn't under an umbrella of \"Student Activities\" like it is today. In some ways, the students were more active in that they put on plays, traveled abroad and had some big events off campus. There weren't as many students, so you knew the majority of them, especially those who were active.</p> <p>Now there is more structure and we are able to offer more activities for free or at a very minimal cost for students. There are a lot of great scholarships available now that were not available then. The campus bookstore was in a mobile trailer on the parking lot of Riverside, and I took a course in a trailer on the lot, too.</p> <h3>What are the benefits for students who become involved in student activities?</h3> <p>I believe when students get involved in student activities, they open up so many opportunities for themselves. From the leadership program to being part of a club or organization or forming a team to participate in RACCy Olympics, there are many benefits. When a student has been involved, it can help her/him to get an edge on competitive admission to another college, jobs and scholarship opportunities. I not only see these students receive scholarships to help at RACC, but some receive full tuition for their second half of their bachelor's degree at a state university or private colleges from $10,000 to $30,000 per year. </p> <p>By getting involved, students gain a network of other students from all areas of the College, access to sit on College committees, and opportunities to speak with administrators about the RACC experience. They also form a bond with RACC that goes on far beyond their future schools. Our students are very successful and no matter where they receive their undergraduate or post-graduate degrees, they have a loyalty to the school that opened them up to so many opportunities.</p> <h3>What are some of the best events that you have helped to organize? </h3> <p>The leadership program at RACC has grown from two, four-hour sessions a year to a year-long program that includes two retreats off campus, six full Fridays in the summer, and three full days in January. There is also a second tier of the program that gives students an opportunity to mentor other students in the program. We have also just added a new process so that leaders can earn certification and recognition at commencement.</p> <p>Another memorable experience was being chairperson for the inaugural Relay for Life of Reading, and serving the next four years as well. In five years we were able to raise over half a million dollars for the American Cancer Society and RACC teams raised more than $12,000 each of those five years. In addition to raising money for much-needed research and patient services, we played an important role in getting information out to everyone. We also had a brand new van given to ACS at our inaugural event that is used to provide rides for patients to treatment.</p> <p>Through my experience with Relay, I was able to work with very talented students to bring the inaugural RACCy Olympics to RACC last year. The student teams with one staff team raised $17,113.91 for Caitlin's Smiles, the designated benefactor for the first two years of the event. Our goal for 2012 is $18,000 and the students and staff have started fundraising already for the next event in April. I am in awe of the commitment of our students and staff to help others.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Leading an Active Life - Q&A with Sue Gelsinger", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/sueG.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/sueG.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

The first event was held with just a handful of people running through the campus. </p><p>Over time, the race has evolved, thanks in large part to Ben Rosenberger, the Director of Financial Aid and Registrar at RACC. \"In 2004, the school was going to drop the race because they had been losing money on it and someone needed to take it over,\" Rosenberger said. \"David Richards, who worked in our IT department, approached me and asked if I would help.</p> <p>\"I told him if he focused on running the race, I would work on getting sponsorships so we'd at least break even,\" he added.</p> <p> Under their watchful eye, the race grew into a well-known Berks County event that draws some of the best local runners \u2013 at least when the weather is nice.</p> <p>\"A sunny day can be the difference between 100 runners and 300 runners,\" said Rosenberger. \"A lot of runners don't make the decision to run until they wake up that morning and see the sun shining. So, we moved it back this year and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\"</p> <p> Another key factor in their growth has been the increased support from the RACC community, including dedicated staff members and student volunteers. </p> <p> Rosenberger added that this event is not just for adult runners. It is a true family event that includes a \u00bd mile Kids Fun Run. \"It's so cool to see the kids come across the finish line and get that medal. It's something that could light a passion for the future,\" he said.\" </p><p>\"As the race continues to grow, Rosenberger is hoping they can eventually raise $10,000 which would create an endowed scholarship for RACC students. \"Almost every race has a cause and this scholarship would be a great example of community service,\" Rosenberger said. \"This event gets RACC's name out there and promotes fitness and being healthy since a mind without a body is useless.\"</p> <p>\"An exciting addition to the RACC Race this year is the launch of <a href=\"GirlsRun.aspx\">Girls on the Run</a>, which is being championed by RACC alum and employee Kim Rivera.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "A Closer Look at the RACC Run", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/RunCloser.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/RunCloser.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

In fact, Berks is the second-largest producing county after Chester County.</p> <p>For Phil Coles, an adjunct instructor at RACC, mushrooms have played a key role in his life and led to some amazing experiences. For the last 30 years, he has managed the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program at Giorgi Mushroom Co. (Giorgio Foods/Fresh) here in Berks County.</p> <p>\"Integrated Pest Management means no more automatic pesticide applications based on a schedule. In IPM you must understand pest biology, monitor for pests, make the environment unattractive to pests and use a variety of control techniques, all integrated into one pest management plan,\" Phil explained.</p> <p>Phil also integrates his work into the Environmental Science classroom as he teaches here. \"I invite all of the students in my class to come out and see real-world research,\" he said.</p> <p>Once he started teaching at RACC, the experience inspired him to return to school, earning an MBA from Lehigh University. During his time at Lehigh, Phil was awarded a fellowship to study at the University of Nottingham and visit businesses in the United Kingdom. </p> <p>\"We studied Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and green supply chains,\" he said, \"In CSR, companies focus on what is known as the triple bottom line, People, Planet, and Profit. Customers are concerned about how companies produce products and services, and the impact on people and the environment. This can also contribute to increased profitability.\"</p> <p>Phil is entering his second year as a trainer and consultant for Northeastern IPM at Cornell University, in structural pest management. As part of this, he travels across the country and works with public housing authorities training management, pest control professionals, staff and residents in preventative measures such as how to make buildings unattractive to pests, in addition to the safest and most effective pest management techniques.</p> <p>In addition to traveling locally, Phil also was asked to present at Shaanxi and The China Agricultural Universities as an invited lecturer where he lectured on IPM as used in mushroom cultivation. \"Their per capita mushroom consumption per person in China is much higher than ours,\" he said, \"They were very interested in technology. It's amazing how much is still done by hand there.\"</p> <p>Along with traveling, Phil also is active on several advisory boards, including the Pennsylvania Pesticide Advisory Board, of which was involved with IPM in schools that uses monitoring instead of automatic\u2013\u2013and maybe unnecessary\u2013\u2013\u2013 pesticide use. Phil's professional resum\u00e9 includes a volunteer position as president of the PA Certified Organic Advisory Board and monthly columnist for Mushroom News. </p> <p>So, how did Phil end up with a career relating to pest management and mushrooms?</p> <p>It all started during his undergraduate days at Penn State where he was majoring in biology. \"One of my professors had two lists on his door, one for best majors to get a job and one for the worst majors. My major, Biology, was on the worst list,\" he said. </p> <p>This drove Phil to investigate other options and he changed from biology to Entomology, in the College of Agriculture, which had a better career outlook. \"In Entomology, the classes were so small that we were lumped in with graduate students, so I received graduate level education as an undergraduate,\" he said. \"Then, I was looking for a research project and mushrooms were the only thing growing in winter, once I saw what was involved in mushroom cultivation, I was hooked.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "The Mushroom Man", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/coles.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/coles.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

It was participatory.\"</p> <p>The book has strong ties to RACC, including the cover photo of Dr. Morgan along with RACC students in the College's meditation garden, which was a concept developed in one of his classes. Also, the preface was written by Dr. Linda Lewis Riccardi, an adjunct professor of philosophy at RACC. </p> <p>Dr. Morgan was an administrator at RACC during its early years, and he taught the College's very first philosophy class. He then left RACC to pursue two master's degrees and a doctorate, as well as work in different areas of the community.</p> <p>Dr. Morgan later returned to RACC and spent almost eight years as an adjunct instructor. He has also taught at several other colleges and universities and at a theological school.</p> <p>One of the ideas that Dr. Morgan frequently proposed during his RACC classes is that children are natural philosophers because of all of their questions. He was an inquisitive child himself. \"My mother once told me that I was always asking questions and she was a patient person who listened and encouraged me,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of questions and I hope some of the wonder and joy of asking them that I had as a child. </p> <p>\"Aristotle said philosophy begins in wonder, and I hope I have kept that wonder alive,\" he added.</p> <p>During his time at RACC, Dr. Morgan encouraged his students to become involved with children in the community, which led to the creation of the RACC Readers. The first year, students from one of his philosophy classes visited Tyson Schoener Elementary School to read to children. The following year, students read to the kids in RACC's Education Laboratory Center. </p> <p>\"Being involved in the community is part of what it means to me to be a philosopher,\" Dr. Morgan said. \"I also am someone who believes in the word 'community' in RACC. It should be the heart of what RACC is and does, what makes it unique.\"</p> <p>While Dr. Morgan enjoys writing books, he said it's the students and their memories that he will always carry with him. \"Their stories of overcoming sometimes incredible obstacles to pursue learning\u2013\u2013 they were an inspiration to me,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I'd have to write an encyclopedia to cover all the stories students told in my classes,\" Dr. Morgan added. \"In fact, from where I often sit at my desk at home, I keep a picture of two children of a former student. On the back she wrote: 'You've given me many stories to share with' my children. Actually I have collected more stories from students than they from me.\" </p> <p>Along with this latest book, Dr. Morgan has also published seven other books, most recently <em>Psychology of Death and Dying</em> and <em>Dear Brothers: Letters Facing Death</em>. While recently finding success with his books, his first published works were short articles and poems. \"I papered my walls with rejection slips for some time, but didn't give up,\" he said. \"Writing well is tough work but incredibly rewarding.\"</p> <p>Dr. Morgan's most recent books are available on the publisher's website at <a href=\"https://wipfandstock.com/\">www.wipfandstock.com</a>.

D., RN, was filling prescriptions for hundreds of patients in South Sudan, Africa.</p> <p>Dr. Capotosta traveled with an independent faith-based group for a mission trip to the newly- formed country. The group visited different villages and spent the days providing medical care to the local people.</p> <p>\"You saw a lot of malaria, respiratory problems, worms and fungus,\" said the Chairperson of the Health Professions Division. \"Some of what you saw, too, was typical aches and pains that you see here. But, there, it's worse because the sicknesses are not treated.\"</p> <p>For Dr. Capotosta, this was one of several trips she has taken over the last few years. She first got involved when she saw an advertisement at her church. She then went on the Internet to research different organizations, places and what kind of needs existed. Dr. Capotosta ultimately settled on a faith-based group that exemplified her Christian beliefs.</p> <p>\"I feel it is important to treat others as I would want to be treated,\" said Dr. Capotosta, who has also traveled to Ghana, India, Haiti and South Africa. \"To me that means sometimes getting out of my comfort zone and being willing to take time, effort and money to relate to people, to do something good that counts for more than the here and now.\"</p> <p>Dr. Capotosta traveled with 10 other medical professionals or people familiar with the healthcare environment on this trip. Long-term missionaries hosted them on this trip and provided shelter at a compound where they were also running a dental clinic.</p> <p>Her living arrangements featured a building without electric and cold running water was limited, so they had to be very conservative. Dr. Capotosta also said there were lizards that would run through now and then and bats outside at night. For meals, the group dined on fried bread and hard boiled eggs for breakfast, and rice and beans for dinner.</p> <p>The villages the group visited were very rural and required traveling on roads that would be closed here in our country due to their bad condition. It was the rainy season, so she said it rained about every day.</p> <p>The villages they traveled to often had no electric or running water and the people lived in mud huts with thatched roofs. She said the people were industrious and many of them were farmers.</p> <p>While there are numerous countries in African featured on the news for their dire conditions or tribal wars, Dr. Capotosta said she never had any fear about traveling there to help.</p> <p>\"I could go outside and get hit by a bus,\" she said. \"I've never had an issue on a trip. This time there was some fighting that broke out again in the north and some of our translators were called back to active duty. But it did not bother us.\"</p> <p>So just why does she risk her safety, take 20-hour flights and travel to all of these countries? She admits that it is rewarding to see the reactions of the local people. \"They are very grateful and appreciative. In my role, the translators are very important so that the people understand what medication they are taking and how to take it.</p> <p>Although, Dr. Capotosta also noted that many of the people spoke English. She said there were schools in the villages, although often it may be only one person attending from a family since they did have to pay a small amount to attend.</p> <p>Dr. Capotosta rewarded herself at the end of the trip with an extended stay that allowed her to take a safari and see all of the amazing animals.</p> <p>Despite traveling to numerous counties already over the last few years, Dr. Capotosta is already looking forward to planning next year's mission.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "RACC's Dr. Capotosta: A Woman on a Mission", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/Amelia.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/Amelia.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},
{"body": "<img class=\"rightimage\" height=\"225\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/News/Features/images/schmehl.jpg\" width=\"335\"/> <p>After more than 30 years in the nursing profession, Patricia Schmehl joined the nursing faculty at RACC and now is celebrating her first published book, <em>Introduction to Concept Mapping in Nursing.</em></p> <p>\"I started thinking, 'How can students best learn?' You see the differences in how students interpret and apply concepts,\" she said. \"We all have different learning styles, so how can we as teachers show them what it is to critically think.\"</p> <p>Patricia said the entire process took about 18 months. The book will soon be released and available at the RACC Bookstore, in Yocum Library and online retailers Amazon.com, BarnesandNoble.com and jblearning.com. </p> <p>While Patricia said the idea of concept mapping in general isn't new, it is relatively new to the nursing field. At its most basic level, a concept map is a diagram that shows the relationship among different concepts. Concept mapping is a graphic teaching and learning tool that helps students learn and study by developing critical thinking skills.</p> <p>RACC students first engage with concept mapping during their Nursing 200 course in the fall semester of their second year. Patricia admits students don't necessarily like it, but they do learn to appreciate its value.</p> <p>\"Concept mapping is a lot of work for them since it becomes a nursing care plan,\" said Patricia, who was born and raised in Reading. \"It's based on a patient they worked with, so it reinforces and layers information. They comprehend better and learning takes on new meaning.\"</p> <p>Patricia has been part of RACC's Nursing faculty for almost 10 years and first came to the College as an adjunct instructor. She was working as a Nurse Practitioner at Berks Cardiology when she saw an advertisement. She said once she started teaching, she really liked the idea of being able to blend her love of nursing with her desire to teach.</p> <p>\"Teaching was always my focus,\" said Patricia. \"When I was working in the hospital, it was working with patients and their families to continue their treatment regimen when they went home. Now, to teach students and the future generation of nurses is great.\"</p> <p>Patricia always had an interest in nursing, stemming from seeing older relatives in hospitals and how kind the nurses were to them. She attended St. Joseph's Hospital School of Nursing, then went on to Kutztown for her bachelor's degree and Seton Hall for her Master's degree.</p> <p>\"When I was looking at getting my Master's degree, there weren't a lot of places to go for an online program,\" Patricia said. \"I was working full-time and I had kids, so online was easier.\"</p> <p>Patricia said she saw the writing on the wall relating to advanced degrees for nurses, which is what spurred her to pursue a position as a Nurse Practitioner. \"I knew the transition would come and that they would be mandating a bachelor's or even a Master's degree,\" she said. \"Plus, I wanted to get into more advanced practice and be able to give back more.\"</p> <p>Although Patricia feels a sense of accomplishment with this book, she said she has plans for another \u2013 this time focused more on the instructors.

As the coordinator for the Pregnant and Parenting Teen Program and a facilitator for the Nurturing Parenting classes, she sees many teenagers and young women who are pregnant and need support.</p> <p>Eighteen years ago, Alicia was just like those young pregnant women, but she was able to turn the corner and provide a stable future for her daughter thanks to RACC.</p> <p>Alicia enrolled at RACC seven years after graduating from what was formerly Holy Name High School (now Berks Catholic). Born and raised in the Northwest section of Reading, she found herself pregnant, unmarried and working as a bartender, knowing it would not be enough to support her child.</p> <p>\"Realizing that changes needed to occur, I decided to return to college in order to provide a future my daughter,\" said Alicia, who now has two children. \"The thought of returning to school terrified me as high school was often unbearable. While academically my grades were average, socially I was often bullied because of my economic background and my physical appearance.\"</p> <p>\"RACC seemed like the most logical choice. I knew that many adults attended RACC and I thought I could blend in. I never imagined the positive effect RACC would eventually have on me and how that journey changed my life forever,\" she added.</p> <p>As an unemployed single mother, Alicia qualified for the ACT 101 program which focuses on helping academically and financially disadvantaged students to complete college. In addition to financial aid, Alicia utilized one-on-one mentoring as part of ACT 101. She credits the counseling and support she received from the staff with helping her to discover her true self.</p> <p>\"I never imagined that academically, I could achieve greatness,\" she said. \"I never imagined that I could sit in a classroom and not worry about people laughing at my weight. RACC instilled in me the value of an education and gave me the greatest gift - pride. I will always be grateful to my instructors at RACC. They truly challenged me to excel and I never forgot many of the lessons they taught me.\"</p> <p>Alicia, who graduated from RACC with a degree in criminal justice, continued on earning a bachelor's degree, also in criminal justice, from Alvernia University.</p> <p>From there, Alicia entered the workforce, starting briefly at Lebanon County Children and Youth Services before moving to Berks County Children and Youth where she spent almost 10 years. Alicia's responsibilities included in-home evaluations working with parents to develop an ongoing family services plan, assessing risk to children in the home and investigating allegations of child abuse.</p> <p>\"I think I always knew I wanted to help others and I learned that I am good at it and I love it,\" she said. \"I want to continue to work with the community, but I never feel like I am doing enough. I want to become an even stronger presence here in Reading.\"</p> <p>In 2010, with her growing confidence and career background, Alicia returned to school at St. Joseph's University earning her master\u2019s degree in criminal justice in August.</p> <p>\"Attending RACC provided me with a solid foundation for my future educational needs,\" Alicia said. \"The instructors at RACC taught me to think critically, write on a college level, and that the motivation to succeed goes a very long way. Most importantly, RACC helped me to see there was so much more to me than what was on the outside and gave me the courage to further my education.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Gaining Confidence", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/AliciaKline.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/AliciaKline.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

Dave oversees 19 analysts that serve as the first-level support for all IT issues on a 24-hours-a-day/7-days-a-week basis.</p> <p>\"When I lost my job, and my wife and I were deciding which way to go, little did I know then that IT was a perfect place for me,\" said Dave, who has been with the Reading Health System since 2002.</p> <p>\"I talk to people all day long, provide customer service to over 10,000 users and am helping people on a daily basis. Many folks do not like dealing with people all day long but I really do enjoy what I'm doing,\" he added.</p> <p>Dave, a native of Berks County and graduate of the former Mount Penn High School (now Antietam), earned an associate degree in Computer Networking from RACC in 2001. \"I chose RACC based on the courses they had to offer, the growing reputation during that time period, and the comfort level I felt with the school's commitment to the community and folks like me who were older, laid off and looking to start a new career,\" he said. \"I never felt out of place there or in over my head. Everyone was treated equally regardless of age, education, race and background.\"</p> <p>Dave always liked working with computers, especially MS Office products, but had his concerns about being a first-time college student at the age of 44.</p> <p>\"I remember the MS Office and programming classes,\" he said. \"The classes were well done, the instructors were positive, encouraging to students who never attended college before.

She dreamed of becoming a television anchor and hosting her own talk show someday.</p> <p>It all started at RACC where she enrolled in the Dual Enrollment Program that allowed her to take college classes part-time while she was still in high school. After graduating from Wilson High School in 2008, she attended RACC full-time.</p> <p>\"My favorite classes were communications classes because I learned the most from them,\" said Abigail, who moved to Berks County with her family during her high school years after living in New York. \"I wasn't really good at English and communications classes, so I had to work really hard for my good grades.\"</p> <p>Abigail also wrote for the <em>Front Street Journal</em>, participated in the Leadership Program and belonged to the dance team. She also worked in the Admissions Office through the work-study program.</p> <p>During her time at RACC, BCTV offered Abigail an internship, which confirmed her career choice. Her experience with BCTV also helped her earn the College and University Public Relations Association of Pennsylvania (CUPRAP) Communications Internship Award in 2009. The award provides a stipend for college tuition to students who secure an internship.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't have won it if it wasn't for the education I received at RACC. To earn that scholarship I had to write press releases, features, and news articles,\" said Abigail, who earned her Communications Transfer degree in 2010.</p> <p>Abigail credits Professor David Leight for setting her on a path after RACC.</p> <p>\"Because of the information he shared with me, I decided to go to Temple University in Philadelphia without even visiting there. I just applied, was accepted, became an Owl and loved it,\" she added.</p> <p>At Temple, Abiagail became even more immersed in the world of communications and media. She produced, anchored and reported for Temple University Television (TUTV). She hosted her own radio show called Spanglish and eventually became the Promotions Manager for the campus radio station WHIP (We Have Infinite Potential).</p> <p>\"While at Temple I was gaining more experience, and a week before my college graduation, I was called in for an interview with NBC10 in Philadelphia,\" Abigail said. \"A week before graduation I got hired as a Production Assistant for the morning shift which was 3am-12pm. I worked mostly every day and loved it.\"</p> <p>Abigail's full-time position with NBC10 was specifically designed for recent college graduates.

She is currently the lead anchor, producer and editor of the local Univision station.</p> <p>\"My biggest advice is to take advantage of all opportunities, be persistent, be a hard worker, and last but definitely not least, seek out internships,\" she said. \"This business is all about experience, so the more internships you can do, the better your chances of landing a job.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "In Front of the Camera", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/AbigailCamilo.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/AbigailCamilo.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

Most students are lucky to have a job lined up for after graduation, but Matt still has a semester left at RACC and is already working full-time. He was able to turn a contracted position into a full-time job with a nice salary and benefits.</p> <p>A Website Development major, Matt is working as an Engineering Technician at an Air Products facility in Trexlertown. He supports the engineering departments with various information technology tasks. Matt said it was RACC instructor Liz Dentzer, who he had for Programming and Networking, that started the ball rolling for him with Air Products.</p> <p>\"Last April I got an e-mail from her asking if I needed a new job,\" Matt said. \"I sent my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and went through the interview process and became a contractor working for an outside company at the Air Products facility. </p> <p>\"I started pushing several months ago for Air Products to hire me on with a permanent position,\" Matt continued. \"Once it was decided that they would make my job a permanent position with the company, I had to go through the interview process again, which was extremely nerve-racking. Having to interview for my own job was a risk, but I took it and it paid off.\"</p> <p>In his new position, Matt works full-time Monday through Friday and then comes to class at RACC on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. While he's happy at RACC and now has a clear career path, Matt said it wasn't always that way.</p> <p>A 2007 graduate of Exeter High School, Matt spent a semester at a four-year college, but wasn't sure what he wanted to do. Instead of continuing down an undecided road, he opted to take time off and travel as a missionary. He spent two years living in the area around Mexico City working with other missionaries to help local residents make changes in their lives.</p> <p>In addition to his own work, Matt picked up other responsibility including the financial operations of the entire mission.</p> <p>\"My experience as a missionary helped me more than I could ever explain, and I continue benefiting from those experiences each day, most notably my ability to communicate fluently in Spanish,\" Matt said. </p> <p>\"I also have a deep understanding of the comings and goings of an office environment and the need for effectiveness and precision in a workplace due to my missionary experiences. I also have a profound love for anything and everything that has to do with Latin culture,\" he added.</p> <p>That love for Latin culture carried from his spiritual work into his personal life. Just two weeks after returning from Mexico, Matt attended a church function where he met his future wife, Maria \u2013 who is originally from Honduras. The couple now has an infant son, and she was supportive of his decision to return to school.</p> <p>While Matt knew he was ready for school, he was not ready to spend an unnecessary amount of money on an education. He looked into RACC not only because of the cost, but because his father had attended RACC for a degree in Computer Networking after being laid off from the textile industry.</p> <p>Matt enrolled for the 2011 fall semester and said two of his web professors have made a tremendous impact on him. \"Dave Mollura and Marty Kelly have taught seven of the courses I have taken at RACC,\" Matt said. \"I have been able to build an excellent relationship with both of them through the numerous hours we've spent together. </p> <p>\"I know you can't include the names of all of my teachers here, but I really haven't had a teacher who hasn't influenced me in a positive way,\" he added.</p> <p>Down the line, Matt said he'd like to start his own website design business, \"I love what I do because I enjoy helping people and teaching people how to make their own job a little easier. I enjoy working on websites in my free time, but with this job, I don't have to fully rely upon that as a source of income.\"</p> <p>To learn more about RACC's website design program, please visit our website.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Taking a Risk", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/cambria.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/cambria.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

She volunteered in New York after 9/11 and then years later traveled to Haiti after their devastating earthquake.</p> <p>Now, Erica, a native of Finland, is at RACC taking classes for a certification that will also allow her to help others in need\u2013\u2013Certified Nurse Aide program. Erica received the Mae W. Langan scholarship from the Foundation for RACC to help pay for her classes.</p> <p>In Finland, Erica received what would be the equivalent of a Licensed Practical Nurse certificate here. However, she said it was difficult to earn certifications here due to a delayed immigration process and lack of valid paperwork during the time she was waiting to obtain her U.S. citizenship.</p> <p>Erica completed the CNA program and passed her Red Cross certification exam. She is now working at The Highlands in Wyomissing where she will continue her passion for assisting those in need. \"Helping others is close to my heart. Disaster areas are close to my heart. I am not afraid to face or deal with life conflicts, and I am well trained to face hardship situations,\" she said.</p> <p>In 2001, Erica was vacationing in New York City when the events of 9/11 struck. Trained as a Practical Nurse in Finland, she decided to extend her one-week stay to offer her assistance. \"A local high school near where I was staying became a triage center. I stayed there for two weeks and in the Ground Zero area for more than a month \u2013 helping the American Red Cross with people, victims, fellow officers and EMS personnel in need, in recovery. I sometimes stayed awake up to 26 hours or without eating for more than an 18 hours during my intensive day and night shifts.\"</p> <p>Then my heart got tired and it was time to take care of myself, so I returned to Finland,\" she added.</p> <p>During her time in New York, Erica drew upon her previous artillery-naval paramedic and auxiliary law enforcement experience in Finland. She grew up in Kirkkonummi, on the outskirts of Helsinki, but served in Upinniemi which has a large naval base.</p> <p>\"The whole island is an unmanned military installation and access for civilians is heavily restricted. A number of Coastal Artillery guns are placed there,\" Erica explained. \"The military service consists of lessons, practical training, various cleaning and maintenance duties and field exercises.\"</p> <p>Erica said the day's service lasted 12 hours, but received most weekends off. \"A small force of service members is kept in readiness on weekends to aid civil agencies in various types of emergency situations, to guard the premises and to maintain defense in case of a sudden military emergency,\" she said.</p> <p>She put her emergency training to work again in 2010 when disaster struck in Haiti and Erica spent her own money to travel to Port-au-Prince. She had to deal with some very difficult conditions like little food and drinking water, using water from a well and a bucket to wash up. Most of the electricity came from generators that the U.S. Army had installed, so it was rationed at times to benefit as many people possible.</p> <p>Erica was with a group who worked at the Port-Au-Prince general hospital, which is known as Haitian University Hospital, that was damaged by the earthquake. \"Staff who survived the earthquake returned to the hospital only to struggle to treat thousands of badly wounded patients,\" Erica said. \"Their efforts were seriously compromised as they worked without electricity or running water, and with little or no surgical equipment, anesthesia, pain medication or sterilization.\"</p> <p>Some of Erica's responsibilities included setting up IVs, drawing blood samples, vaccinations, delivery of babies, stitching wounds and providing other emergency care.

Jessica was a home-school student when her mom learned about Early Admissions and the opportunity to take classes at RACC. She placed into honors level English, and answered only one question wrong. \"I was pretty excited about this opportunity. I had no idea what to expect, and my middle school experience did not prepare me for the college one,\" she recalled.</p> <p>Jessica said, thankfully, Professor Karen Jacobsen, who started the Honors Program at RACC, was her instructor for Honors English Composition. \"It was over my head, but she really went out of her way to help me learn, seeing that I was willing to make the effort. She met with me after class to help me understand the basics of writing college level papers. I actually still have one of the research papers that I got a C+ on, so I definitely had a lot to learn,\" Jessica said.</p> <p>In addition to Honors English, Jessica took two history classes with Professor John Lawlor. Since she had a strong interest in a creative writing career, he allowed her to write a creative non-fiction piece instead of standard research papers.</p> <p>Jessica fueled her writing passion by getting involved as the Arts and Entertainment Editor and a contributing writer of the <em>Front Street Journal</em>, and by submitting works to <em>Legacy</em>, the College's scholarly journal. Jessica said she remembers writing and storytelling even as a young child.</p> <p>\"I would make up stories with my Barbies, then by the time I was 16 I wrote two novellas,\" she said. \"I would just write every night in the family room. My passion for writing came from the desire to help others learn lessons through my stories.\"</p> <p>After taking a few classes over three years at RACC, Jessica transferred those credits and used them to graduate early from Penn State with a bachelor's degree in Film-Video. She loved the idea of seeing a story she wrote come to life on the big screen.</p> <p>\"My overall experience with being educated at RACC was great. The staff is so willing to work with you and make the experience personal,\" Jessica said. \"Most importantly, my mom and sister were the best support system. My mom drove me to all the classes until I could drive, and my older sister helped me with my papers outside of class and was always willing to answer any questions.\"</p> <p>RACC was also the place where she took her first Yoga class, and she is now the proud owner of her own business, YogiDance. YogiDance is a program for kids that combines yoga, hula hooping and relaxation to improve children's balance and flexibility, and boost their self-confidence.</p> <p>Jessica had Scoliosis as a child that required surgery and realized that she wanted to have a career that would impact children. \"My calling just fell into place. I had no idea that I would do this, just that my desire to help others improve their lives is a strong driving force for everything that I do,\" she said.</p> <p>As a business owner, Jessica felt her well-rounded skill set from her alternative education was a necessity. She also sees similarities between taking responsibility for her education and now for her paycheck and career. Jessica said the possibilities in her future are endless and that someday she would like to publish a book.</p> <p>\"When I tell people that I started at RACC at 14 I always hear, 'You must be really smart,'\" Jessica said. \"I would say that it takes more than being smart. It takes a desire for achieving your goals whatever the path may be, and even better if you make your own path. From my experience I would tell people never to believe what other people tell you. If they say there's no way, you can find one; anything is possible.\"</p> <p>You can learn more about Jessica and YogiDance by visiting her website at <a href=\"http://www.yogidance.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.yogidance.com</a>.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Getting a Head Start", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/jessica_walsh.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/jessica_walsh.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

Studios and met dozens of professionals from the media industry during the annual National Broadcasting Society (NBS) annual conference in March. His dream is to someday be among those ranks.</p> <p>It all started four years ago when he was a student at RACC. Now, Matt is in his second year at Kutztown University as an Electronic Media major and is set to graduate in May. Kutztown's chapter of the NBS was named co-Chapter of the Year and Matt enjoyed all the perks of the conference celebration. He met Marc Summers, who many of us grew up watching as the host of Nickelodeon\u2019s \"Double Dare.\" Summers is now the host of \"Unwrapped\" on the Food Network.</p> <p>\"My favorite part of the trip was touring Warner Bros. Studios,\" Matt said. \"I had the opportunity to go inside the sound stages. I even saw the \"Two and A Half Men\" set!\"</p> <p>In addition to the NBS, Matt is active in multiple student organizations including the Radio Club, Newsbreak and Mic Check. \"This past semester I hosted an alternative rock show on Mondays called 'Backseat Underground,'\" he said. \"In honor of the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death, I did a show entirely of Nirvana songs.\"</p> <p>Student activities have been a consistent theme of Matt's college career. As a communications student at RACC, Matt wrote for the <em>Front Street Journal</em> newspaper.</p> <p>\"The first story that I wrote was about Ray Krone, who spent a decade behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of a brutal murder in Phoenix, Arizona,\" said Walsh. Krone spent three years on Arizona's death row. It was definitely an eye-opener for me, and caused me to question what I already knew about the criminal justice system.</p> <p>\"I also covered stories such as Dr. Jill Biden's visit to RACC, as well as other guest speakers who come to campus, like Matt Glowacki and Traciana Graves,\" he added.</p> <p>Matt also enjoyed his time in the classroom and highlighted some of his favorite courses including history, writing and philosophy.</p> <p>\"I loved Mr. Lawlor's history class. The class was a no-brainer for me, because history classes were always one of my strongest subjects. My writing courses inspired me to become a better writer. Introduction to Philosophy course was memorable as well,\" said Matt, who graduated from Exeter High School in 2010.</p> <p>While a student at RACC, Matt learned about the dual admissions agreement with Kutztown University that makes it easier to transfer between the two schools. The agreement also waives the Kutztown application fee and provides academic scholarships to qualified students. As a dual admissions student, Matt attended the Connections program before his graduation and was able to meet the chairperson of the Electronic Media department.</p> <p>Matt advises other students interested in dual admissions or planning to transfer to meet with their academic advisor and talk with the school they want to attend to fully understand the process and how courses will transfer.</p> <p>As he looks forward to his graduation from Kutztown, Matt said he's happy that he followed his parents' advice and made the choice to start at RACC.</p> <p>\"They felt that I was not yet ready to handle going to a four-year college right away,\" he said. \"Attending RACC was a smart move because I was still close to home and it was very affordable. I was able to balance a part-time job and attend school at the same time.\"</p> <p>Learn more about <a href=\"/Admissions/DualAdmissions/default.aspx\">Dual Admissions</a> and other <a href=\"/Transfer/Guides/default.aspx\">transfer opportunities</a> on our website.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Communicating", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/MattWalsh.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/MattWalsh.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

A substance abuse problem sidetracked him during his first month of classes and he didn\u2019t go back.</p> <p>Then, a mutual friend introduced him to Auria Bradley, a RACC employee and alumnus. She encouraged him to give college another chance and the two remained close friends. \u201cSince I met her, she has always been very supportive of me and encouraged me to begin setting goals for myself. She continues to be a vision of hope for me both professionally and personally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In addition to Auria\u2019s recommendation, Brad said the close proximity, flexible schedules and affordable tuition at RACC were chief among the deciding factors. It did not take long for him to settle on Psychology for a major.</p> <p> \u201cEver since I entered recovery myself, I knew I wanted to become a therapist and work with individuals who struggle with substance abuse disorders,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brad looks back fondly on his time at RACC, citing the care and compassion of many of his instructors. \u201cI could not have asked for a better experience.

Chris has received Information Systems and Computer Technology degrees from RACC, just two of the 20 different associate degrees that are eligible for this new dual admissions program.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a great experience for me,\u201d Chris said. \u201cI chose this program because I can work on my bachelor\u2019s degree and still be home for my children. I use them as inspiration to never give up on completing my degree.\u201d</p> <p>Chris discovered RACC when he was in his 20s and already a father raising two young children.</p> <p>A graduate of Boyertown Area High School, he started working at GlaxoSmithKline right after graduation. Afterwards, he spent more than 10 years bouncing from company to company in the pharmaceutical industry as a Clinical Studies Associate, gathering required documentation for studies to start clinical trials.</p> <p>Then in 2011, he was laid off and knew that he needed a new direction. RACC held the most appeal since he knew it was affordable and would allow him to stay close to his family at home.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first enrolled I had no idea what career I wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cI took the Admission Counselor\u2019s advice and took general education classes for my first two semesters until I figured out what I wanted to do. I had always enjoyed computers and technology and after talking with my neighbors, who were both in the IT field, I decided to start taking IT classes.\u201d</p> <p>Like many students who return to the classroom after time away, Chris admits he had some anxiety at first. Then he discovered the Advantage Program, a federally funded Student Support Services Program that provides services to specific groups of students, including first generation college students, in order to help them succeed. The program includes counseling, transfer trips and cultural experiences.</p> <p>\u201c(The coordinator) sat down with me every semester and would go over my course load and evaluate if I was taking on too much,\u201d he said. \u201cHe helped me plan what classes to take and assisted me with scholarship applications.\u201d</p> <p>Chris learned about the Advantage Program through a classmate who was also a non-traditional student. He attended the transfer tours, and enjoyed off-campus activities like Reading Fightin\u2019 Phils and Reading Royals games, as well as visiting haunted attractions around Halloween. Chris said it was one of the informal pizza parties where he learned about RACC\u2019s agreement with Bloomsburg for the on-campus bachelor\u2019s degree.</p> <p>In addition to the students in the Advantage Program, Chris formed strong relationships with his instructors and classmates, settling into a solid routine after his first semester.</p> <p>\u201cI feel I was very fortunate with my time at RACC with a great group of classmates in my program and professors that really cared about my academic success,\u201d he said. \u201cThat helped me in completing my personal goal of becoming a member of Phi Theta Kappa by the time I graduated.\u201d</p> <p>Along with reaching his personal goals, he also enjoyed seeing how much his children loved the idea of him going to school, too. \u201cThey are always asking me how I did on a test or asking what I learned in class,\u201d he said. \u201cThey even were my models for drawing class.\u201d</p> <p>Just recently, he and his children celebrated his new full-time job as a School Technician II in the IT department at his alma mater, Boyertown.

Nate Brandt started at RACC as an education major after graduating from Governor Mifflin High School. Now, both men are studying for a career in the growing field of mechatronics with classes at the Schmidt Training and Technology Center (STTC).</p> <p>Like the rest of the College, diversity abounds in the STTC. While Alan and Nate represent two opposite ends of the spectrum, there are also plenty of students in the middle. Many companies send their current employees to the STTC for training as well. What unites them all is the quest for a stable career in the growing field of advanced manufacturing.</p> <p>\"The combination of the baby boomer retirements, the increase in automated highly- sophisticated manufacturing equipment and a dry pipeline of technically educated workers have created a frenzy in the hunt for candidates to fill new and existing technical jobs,\" said Bonnie Spayd, Director of Business and Industry Programs at the STTC. </p> <p>\"This is one of the few areas of employment in the U.S. where skilled technicians will likely get multiple job offers and have tremendous opportunity for upward mobility \u2013 both in position and salary \u2013 within their place of employment,\" she added.</p> <p>Alan first visited the STTC last summer after receiving special Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA) funding because his last job at a local pharmaceutical company was sent overseas to a foreign plant. He said a friend who teaches at Berks County Career and Technology Center pointed him to RACC. </p> <p>\"I talked with him and one of his friends and they advised me to look into mechatronics,\" Alan said. \"They said if they were going to start over again they would come to RACC.</p> <p>Alan, a native of Schuylkill County, is working through the Advanced Manufacturing Integrated Systems Technology (AMIST) courses. AMIST provides training in skills ranging from electrical control circuits to pneumatic and hydraulic troubleshooting and electronic process controls. </p> <p>Alan said his funding requires that he spends a minimum of five days and 30 hours at the STTC for his courses. \"It's self-paced, which is great because I would struggle if I had to go at a slower classroom pace,\" he said. \"I use a workbook and the computer and then there are the hands-on skills you have to demonstrate. There are also quizzes that are graded by an instructor.\"</p> <p>When it comes to finding a new job, Alan said he knows the training he has received at the STTC will give him more options. </p> <p>\"The AMIST program focuses on taking care of the machines and programmed controllers, so I'm not locked into one specific field,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm much more versatile and valuable.\"</p> <p>While Alan has spent years in the manufacturing field already, Nate said he never thought about that for a career. He earned good grades at Governor Mifflin, but said he always had a drive to do something hands-on. The affordability and the ability to transfer any general education courses is what initially drew Nate to RACC.</p> <p>\"I started as an Education Transfer major, but my first semester I had to interview people in the field,\" Nate said. \"After talking with them about the economy and how hard it was to get jobs, I decided to open myself up to other possibilities.\"</p> <p>Nate switched to a Science Transfer major thinking he could still become a teacher, but then his mom saw a BCTV program and video about Mechatronics and showed it to Nate. \"It was the perfect compromise,\" Nate said. \"It had the academics with the hands-on.\"</p> <p>Nate, 20, will earn an Associate Degree in Mechatronics Engineering Technology and hopes to graduate in December. \"The program is split into four sections and I'm about three-quarters of the way through. It's self-paced, which is great because you can work ahead or slow down if you need more time.\"</p> <p>The degree program also requires a capstone project that includes skill demonstration and a report that is presented to the entire STTC faculty. Nate said he comes to campus every day from 7:30-3:30 and is working in the STTC labs when he's not in class for one of his general education courses.</p> <p>Nate's long-term goal is to become an engineer. His goal is to start working after he leaves RACC and then enroll for his bachelor's degree on a part-time basis.</p> <p>\"I'd like to use what I learned as a technician to design new products,\" said Nate. \"There is a disconnect between engineers and products on the floor, so I think I would be a lot better engineer to have worked in the field.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Different Paths, Same Goal", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/stoudt_brandt.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/stoudt_brandt.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

Never allowing a challenge to derail him, he recently added world traveler to his list of achievements.</p> <p> Rubiel, a second\u2013year RACC student, spent his winter break in Guinea, Africa with about 15 other people from places like Canada, Finland and other parts of the world. He traveled with his colleague and dance instructor Janet Peck from Olivet Boys and Girls Club's PAL Center for the Arts. For years she tried to convince him to join her on an annual trip to Africa. The stars finally aligned this year thanks to long hours at work and help from his income tax return, and Rubiel set off on his three-week adventure last December.</p> <p> Rubiel attended a dance camp that featured African dance moves and traditions and was taught by a local theatre group. \"I'm not good at dancing, but I like to do it and think it is fun,\" said Rubiel.</p> <p> Rubiel stayed with host African families who had no electricity and spoke no English. \"We had some electricity the first three days, but then nothing. We brought water up from wells to fill buckets to shower. They spoke French to us, but their native dialect with each other,\" he said.</p> <p> Rubiel compared Guinea to Reading and West Reading with the city area congested with traffic, while the outer areas were like woods without trees. He said the roads were so rough that the vehicles had to travel slowly.</p> <p> The main feature that Rubiel noticed was how friendly and happy the local African families were. \"You could be walking down the road and a family is eating, and they invite you to come join them, and they don't even know you. The kids were always playing outside, they had just a stick and a wheel, but they were happy. It was like traveling back in time with no Internet or electronics,\" he said.</p> <p> Back from his adventure, Rubiel is concentrating on finishing his degree at RACC. He changed his major to Early Childhood Teaching (Pre-K-Grade 4), citing his work with Olivet's. <br/> \"I like working with the kids and helping them out,\" he said. \"It's never the same from one day to another. \"To know that I came from no money to being able to help others is pretty amazing.\"</p> <p> Olivet has also played a major role in Rubiel's schooling. He is a recipient of the \"Careers in Two Years\" Scholarship, which was made possible by a pair of anonymous donors who established the program in 2008 to provide funding for deserving Olivet Boys &amp; Girls Club members of Reading and Berks County. The Careers in Two Years portion of this scholarship fund is designated for any member who has graduated from Reading High and intends to attend Reading Area Community College.</p> <p> In the future, Rubiel envisions himself living in a warmer climate and teaching younger children.

That decision took him around the country during a military career, but eventually brought him back home to Pottsville and then RACC when he lost his job.</p> <p>Jim was working as a night shift foreman at a local company when the plant closed and the jobs were sent to Mexico. Although he had practical experience as an electrician, Jim received a myriad of questions about certifications when he applied for jobs. \"PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) wasn't a technology out there when I was learning,\" he said. \u201cI had a variety of experience, but nothing on paper, so I started researching my options.\"</p> <p>Because his job was sent overseas, Jim qualified for Trade Adjustment Assistance funding which would cover the technical training. He thought about completing only the PLC courses, but after talking with the staff at the Schmidt Training and Technology Center, he decided to pursue an associate degree in Mechatronics. He applied for financial aid and is paying out-of-pocket for his credit courses, which are not covered under the TAA funding.</p> <p>Jim found the self-paced training at Schmidt to be similar to his training in the Navy. When he left college the first time, he joined the Navy's construction crew where he trained as an electrician. \"It was almost an identical structure. There were a lot of modules where you do the work and then go to the computer and take a test,\" he said.</p> <p>In fact, Jim even could have done some of the technical training at home, but opted for a structured learning environment free from distractions. In two years, he has taken almost every manufacturing class available at Schmidt, and now just has to finish his credit classes to complete his degree. He is taking 12 credits this semester, an additional 12 in the spring and then earn his degree in May.</p> <p>\"I'd like to find a new job in maintenance/technical management, which is what I was doing before,\" he said. \"I'm hoping with the degree and my practical experience, I'll have a leg up, but I know it's not easy to find a job in any field. I have not ruled out going back for a bachelor's degree since we have agreements in place with great schools like Purdue-Calumet and Penn State.\" Now in his 50s, Jim said he's not sure how much a bachelor's degree would actually help, but he is considering it more for personal achievement. \"I've gotten nothing less than an A since I started here, and I really enjoy school,\" he said.</p> <p>Although Jim is planning for his future, he easily shared stories from his past, including a trip to the North Pole as a Navy diver. Early in his military service, Jim went through the dive training and participated in drills and assignments around the country. \"We spent six weeks diving at the North Pole in an exercise testing new military equipment. We had to build our own camp and lived in tents. Being in the water was warmer than being on land,\" he recalled.</p> <p>After about nine years in the Navy, Jim settled on the west coast and worked in Marine Service, specializing in marine electronics. \"A ship is like a small city.

He had spent 14 years with that company but said he saw the writing on the wall. \"Every couple of months they would let 20 or 25 people go,\" he said. \"I was stressed because it was getting progressively worse.\"</p> <p>Because Quinn lost his job due to foreign competition, he qualified for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) funding to go back to school, but there was a strict process he had to go through to earn the benefit. \"You had to currently be pursuing a high-demand job,\" he said. \"For months, I was searching and applying for jobs, but I found I was either overqualified or under-qualified.</p> <p>Armed with a bachelor's degree in biology from Allentown College (now DeSales University) that he earned right out of high school, Quinn said the healthcare field drew his interest. He decided to pursue the Medical Laboratory Technician Program at RACC.</p> <p>\"I worked with CareerLink, but it was my responsibility to find out what I wanted to do and where. Then they helped submit the paperwork to get it approved,\" Quinn said.</p> <p>Returning to school after 25 years he said was stressful more than anything. \"The technology and how computer-oriented everything is was so different,\" he said. \"I had familiarity with computers, but now you have to get on the computer. I went camping for a weekend and I had no Internet service to get any work done.\"</p> <p>Quinn said a key to his success is treating college like any other eight-hour job. He comes to RACC at the same time every day and spends a full day, even if he doesn't have classes. \"I'm sitting and studying. I just keep looking at my notes and reviewing everything,\" he said. \"That way I don't panic before a test.\"</p> <p>He's enjoying the school environment and the personal attention that is offered at RACC. Because of the small class sizes, he said teachers recognize you and try to work with a student to help them find success. While he is still in the classroom this semester, he is particularly looking forward to the spring when the clinical rotations will begin. During that time, students get to experience different fields within MLT so they can start to determine the area they would like to specialize in after graduation.</p> <p>In addition to his class schedule, Quinn also is active with the College's Health Professions Club, which is composed of students from each of the Health Professions majors. </p> <p>As a full-time college student and dad to three children, Quinn has little time to reflect on the jobs he has held over the years \u2013 from Bachman Pretzels to Alpo pet food.

They try to set it up as much like a regular shop as they can,\" he said.</p> <p>As part of the tech program, Dustin split his sophomore and junior years between the high school and the CTC. He would head to Boyertown and catch an early bus out to the CTC, and then be bused back to Boyertown for afternoon classes at the high school.</p> <p>Dustin said he learned how to perform maintenance work like tire rotations and oil changes, as well as larger repairs like timing belts and oil pumps. \"Besides the garage, there was a theory room that served as a classroom. We had books and regular classwork like essays,\" he said. \"I preferred learning about cars for an hour over some of the other high school classes.\"</p> <p>By his senior year, Dustin had interviewed and been offered a co-op at Tri-County Toyota. He was assigned a mentor from the dealership who showed him the ropes. \"It was a lot of oil changes and tire rotations - basic stuff - when I first started so they could see what I knew. As you start getting better, they might say, 'You're going to learn how to do this today,' and show you something new and more advanced.\"</p> <p>By the summer after his senior year, he became a full-time employee at Tri-County Toyota. He has earned his emissions and inspections license, as well as his refrigerant handling license. \"They do what they can to keep you since you already know their system and how they like things done,\" he said.</p> <p>During his high school years, Dustin found himself with a unique opportunity. The Anti-Defamation League picked 20 ninth graders to serve as peer leaders and teach younger students about diversity and bullying. The peer leaders participated in three days of training on the \"No Place to Hate\" program.</p> <p>\"We would go classroom to classroom and do activities and show video clips,\" he said. \"One activity would be to break them into groups and give each group a lemon. They had to study the lemon and then we put all the lemons in a pile to see if they could find their lemon. It was great for diversity.</p> <p>\"The teachers told me that thought I connected with the students and would make a good teacher,\" he added.</p> <p>Now Dustin is well on his way to combining his love of cars with his interest in teaching. He is considering Temple University's career teaching program after he finishes his degree at RACC. Dustin is one of the President's Scholarship recipients, a prize awarded annually at each Berks County high school. The scholarship covers two years of tuition at RACC.</p> <p>High school seniors can apply for RACC Scholarships <a href=\"../../FinancialAid/Scholarships/default.aspx\">here</a>.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Revving the Engine", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/DustinMauger.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/DustinMauger.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

She then spent her time working on her family's farm and traveling \u2013 extensively.</p> <p>Most recently, Ada spent four months studying as a Bible Scholar in Thailand. She studied in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand and noted that the people were reserved and had deep traditions such as removing your shoes before entering a home. She was one of 30 U.S. students selected for the program, which was taught by four instructors as well as some guest lecturers.</p> <p>\"We studied a lot of Scripture, discussed world views and different religions,\" said Ada, who learned about the program from friends. \"We had four classes a day. We also took mission trips to Cambodia and India as part of the program.\"</p> <p>In India, Ada's group taught English classes during their week-and-a-half visit. In Cambodia, they hosted Bible classes with children and visited with older residents in one of the villages.</p> <p>When she returned from that trip, she decided she wanted to pursue a nursing education. She started with free classes at the Berks County Intermediate Unit to help prepare her for the GED test, which she passed here at RACC in the spring of 2012. That summer, she enrolled for her first classes and is hoping to finish her nursing prerequisites by fall of 2014.</p> <p>College-level classes were a major change for Ada compared to the classes at the IU. \"It is hard work and I spend hours studying, but the instructors are very helpful,\" she said.</p> <p>Adjunct instructor Dan Glass taught Ada in his English Composition class and said, \"Ada is very bright and very driven. She consistently challenged herself to write and research into how social networking adversely affects the psychological and educational lives of young children. Ada's paper was three to four times as long as the average 'acceptable' paper since she chose to do this assignment for honors credit, which I happily awarded to her.\"</p> <p>Ada first started traveling when she was 21, making mission trips to visit friends in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay with local churches. She then spent about 18 months living in Haiti. \"I lived at an orphanage and worked as a kind of nanny to the children. I took some Creole classes, but just the repeated interaction helped me better learn to communicate,\" she said.</p> <p>With her traveling behind her for now, Ada works as a Certified Nurse Assistant, which fuels her desire to finish a nursing degree. \"Seeing all the needs that people have, it's just my personality that I like to care for people.

But issues forced her to withdraw, with a low GPA, resulting in academic probation.</p> <p>Chantell gave up on the idea of college and went to work at the Palmer's factory, but she started to have physical difficulties from the job and made the decision to return to school. Family and friends supported her choice, and she paid out-of-pocket for her first class and her books with the intent of lifting her probation status.</p> <p>She turned her Fs into As and is now just weeks away from completing her degree in secondary education, with the intent of pursuing a bachelor's degree at a Philadelphia area school.</p> <p>\"My biggest fear was that my personal circumstances would prevent me from being academically successful again,\" said Chantell. \"I remember sitting in my classes unable to concentrate because I was so worried about not being able to pay my rent. There were times when I fought back tears as I took exams because I was so hungry and I had no idea when I would have my next meal. It is so heartbreaking when the solution to a personal problem is not as simple as solving an equation or taking good notes.\"</p> <p>As a non-traditional student, Chantell was nervous to return to school, but credits Linda Dapcic, the Student Facilitator in RACC's Student Affairs area, for helping her to persevere. Last February, she was inducted into RACC's chapter of the Phi Theta Kappa honor society. She also tutors fellow students in algebra as an employee of the Tutoring Center.</p> <p>\"Being a part of Phi Theta Kappa is a dream come true,\" she said. \"In the beginning, it felt impossible and now it is my reality. It gives me hope that all my hard work will not go unnoticed.\"</p> <p>\"Commit to Complete means so much to me because I want to help others overcome the same circumstances that I have been through,\" she said. \"I would not be where I am today if I didn't have people in my life who believe in me and are willing to help me so I could focus on my schoolwork. I want to be the reminder to others that there is hope. You can accomplish your goal, so never give up.\"</p> <p>Another <em>Commit to Complete</em> event is happening on April 16 and 17 in the Berks Hall cafeteria from 10 am. to 6 p.m. There will be a bake sale on both days, as well as the banner signing, graduation cap and gowns available for pictures, and thank-you notes available to be given to faculty, staff, and fellow classmates for keeping students motivated on their educational journeys.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Commit to Complete", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/ChantellNichols.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/ChantellNichols.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

You may have seen him working in the Student Records office or at one of the numerous student activities he helped coordinate.</p> <p> Carlos, who graduated from RACC in May with a Liberal Arts degree, made the most of his college opportunity. A graduate of Reading High, he first learned about RACC through the ACHIEVE program that offered students a chance to visit college campuses and learn about the options available.</p> <p> With dreams of becoming a public defender someday, Carlos is currently enrolled at Temple and then hopes to pursue graduate school and law school.</p> <p>\"I took criminal justice in high school and loved that class,\" said Carlos. \"With a Liberal Arts degree from RACC, it just gives me more options and a broader perspective.\"</p> <p> Carlos found the leadership program by surfing RACC's website when he was looking for something to do on campus. \"I figured, 'Why not do it?'\" he said. \"It was fun and you learn so much about becoming a better student and leader. The skills that you learn are good life skills that you can use in the future.\"</p> <p> One of Carlos' favorite parts of being involved with clubs was planning the events, especially the most recent International Festival. A native of the Dominican Republic, he designed the artwork on the poster that was viewed across campus. \"The planning is a lot of stress, but then when you see the outcome as it all comes together, it feels great.\" </p> <p> During his three years at RACC, Carlos' legacy lives in the Student Activities Office. After moving to a supervisory role as a student worker in the Records Office, he advanced to a part-time employee in Student Activities.</p> <p> Sue Gelsinger, RACC's Student Activities Coordinator, said Carlos often went above and beyond his job description.\u00a0 \"Carlos always gave 150% to complete his responsibilities from creating posters for events to making coffee and popcorn in time for the Coffeehouse Series events.\u00a0 In addition to working in the Student Activities Office, he volunteered many hours to design our Leadership Anniversary program book and our Making a Difference book,\" she said.\u00a0</p> <p> Dawn Gieringer, advisor of the Multicultural/International Club described Carlos as someone upon whom she could depend. \"Carlos is unique in many ways, the first of which is that his source of motivation comes from his heart.

Being away from home, Tara found it difficult to focus on school and said she went down the wrong path.</p> <p>In 2007, Tara now a single mother, discovered Berks Women in Crisis and slowly started to put her life in order. She stayed sober and focused on her children.

Then, one of her assignments was to do something to boost her self-esteem. \"I came down to RACC and got some brochures,\" she said.</p> <p>It was two years later before she brought up the idea of school again, this time with her pastor at church. \"He is my spiritual advisor and I met with him for counseling and told him that my goal was to come back to school,\" she said.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010, Tara officially enrolled at RACC, starting with basic writing and math.

This past May, Ryan received an associate degree in Science from RACC, and just a few weeks later, graduated from Exeter High School. </p> <p>Ryan accomplished this through Dual Enrollment, which is a program that allows academically prepared high school students to take college-level courses at their high school and receive college credit. Ryan also enrolled in some of RACC's online courses and accumulated 63 college credits over three years.</p> <p>\"I found out about dual enrollment through my guidance counselor and I started taking the classes in my sophomore year,\" said Ryan, who is now pursuing a bachelor's degree in Biochemistry at Albright College.\u00a0</p> <p>Ryan's first dual enrollment course was AP Biology and later he completed a combination of AP Chemistry, AP Psychology, AP Physics and AP Calculus. \"They were a lot more challenging than my other high school courses.\u00a0The workload was everything I expected, except for AP Biology, which was a lot <em>more</em> work than I expected,\" he said.</p> <p> Students are eligible for dual enrollment courses through any of three requirements: PA standardized assessments, cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher, or recommendation from their high school teacher and guidance counselor. Students are permitted to register for dual enrollment courses providing they meet the high school's guidelines and RACC's course prerequisites.</p> <p> Although Ryan's class sizes averaged between 20 and 30 students, he said not all of the students opted for dual enrollment. However, for him, he said dual enrollment had multiple benefits.</p> <p>\"One benefit was it took the pressure of taking the AP test away because I still got the college credit,\" he said.\u00a0\"It also helped me get two years of college completed before graduating high school, which saves me a lot of time and money.\"\u00a0<br/> In addition to dual enrollment science courses, Ryan took general education classes like English Composition and The Environment. These classes were ideal for him because they were offered online and fit his schedule.</p> <p>As Ryan starts his first year at Albright, he's already looking toward the future.

{"body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.e2campus.com/support/faq\" target=\"_blank\">E2 FAQ's Online</a></p> <p><strong>Q: What is e2Campus?</strong><br/> <strong>A: </strong>e2Campus is a patent pending universal notification system that allows designated administrators to send time-sensitive messages to the mobile phones, email, and/or pagers of their subscribers (students, faculty, staff, radio stations, TV stations, and others). In the event of an emergency, subscribers can get notified immediately of the situation, wherever they are geographically.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do I signup for e2Campus alerts?<br/> </strong><strong>A:</strong> If you are a student or employee, please visit the <a href=\"signup.aspx\">sign up page</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q: People can text me however I cannot receive a message from e2Campus</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> There are two types of text messaging:</p> <ol> <li>Mobile Originated (sending a text message from one phone to another)</li> <li>Mobile Terminated (a non-cellphone to a cell phone)</li> </ol> <p>You may be able to receive Mobile-to-mobile messaging however it appears that mobile terminated messaging is not activated on your account.</p> <p><strong>Q: What is a universal notification system?</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> A universal notification system is defined as a platform to deliver a notification to an entire audience by all means necessary; therefore creating universal coverage to increase the odds that a particular subscriber received the notification in a timely manner.</p> <p><strong>Q: What is a notification?</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> A notification is defined as a form of communication that delivers descriptive information about news or an event, unlike a bell or siren that communicates little information. </p> <p><strong>Q: Can I change my contact preferences?</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> Yes. You can change your account settings to add different email addresses or phone numbers.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do I Opt-Out (remove myself) from receiving e2Campus alerts?<br/> </strong><strong>A:</strong> Please log into your account to opt-out for e2Campus alerts for your school. You may opt-out of one particular group or the entire service.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do I control what shows up on my phone?<br/> </strong><strong>A:</strong> You are given an opportunity to choose the kinds of messages you wish to receive on your mobile phone through a checkbox listing of groups. You can adjust your preferences from your Group settings.</p> <p><strong>Q: Will I receive unsolicited messages (\"SPAM\") on my mobile phone or email account?</strong><br/> A: NO. e2Campus enforces a <a href=\"http://www.e2campus.com/support/zero-spam-policy\" target=\"_blank\">ZERO SPAM</a> policy which clearly prohibits unsolicited messages, and e2Campus does not sell the contact information of our subscribers to third party marketers.</p> <p><strong>Q: Does your service work on multiple cell phone networks?</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> Yes. e2Campus is a cross-carrier service. See a list of wireless carriers supported <a href=\"http://www.e2campus.com/support/carrier-support\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q: Do I need to install software and/or hardware in order to have e2Campus?</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> NO. e2Campus is a 100% web-based software system, so you do not need any additional software or hardware. All you need is a web browser with an Internet connection and you are up and running! You can look at e2Campus as a Public Safety \"Utility\"- always on and ready for action.</p> <p><strong>Q: Will this cost me anything?</strong><br/> <strong>A:</strong> Maybe. Depending on your wireless carrier provider and the plan you have, you may be charged a nominal fee (like ten cents per message) to receive SMS text messages. Many students have unlimited text messaging plans, so there would be no additional charge. </p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/E2Campus/faq.aspx", "path": "/E2Campus/faq.aspx", "folder": "/E2Campus"},

{"body": "<h2>What is work-study?</h2> <p>Work-study employment is a type of financial aid that a student earns in the form of a paycheck. The program is either federally funded or state funded. The funds are intended to help offset educational and living expenses. Wages are earned by working on campus or at an approved off-campus site.</p> <h2>Who can be a work-study employee?</h2> <p>Students are considered for work-study employment based on financial need. A completed FAFSA is required prior to May 1 or receiving a PHEAA State Grant. Eligibility is determined by the Work-Study program in the Financial Aid Office in Room B107. You must be enrolled in a minimum of 6 credits and have at least a 2.0 GPA semester and cumulative.</p> <h2>How do I receive the money?</h2> <p>Unlike many forms of financial aid, the money goes directly to the student instead of the institution. Funds are received in the form of a semi-monthly paycheck. All paychecks are based on a standard hourly wage and the number of hours worked for each pay period.</p> <h2>How much will I get paid?</h2> <p>All federal work-study employees receive a standard hourly rate.

She plans on graduating with honors in the next academic year and envisions a future in counseling or social work with a focus on helping people overcome addictions.</p> <p> During her time at RACC, Patty has taken numerous honors program courses- but admits she was scared of the challenge at first. \"I was hesitant because I was afraid it might be more difficult and time-consuming and take time away from my kids,\" she said. \"Then I remembered that all of my favorite classes in high school were my honors courses, so I tried it with two my first semesters. They are smaller classes, and they are so engaging and enriching.\"</p> <p>With her honors class work, Patty qualified to join RACC's chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for two-year schools. She holds the position of secretary and also got involved in campus activities by submitting some of her writing to Legacy, the College's scholarly journal.</p> <p>\"It's all about being part of a community,\" she said. \"There is something satisfying about giving your time to other people.\"</p> <p>While she's enjoying herself now, Patty's path to college took time to evolve, and like many other RACC students, it's a non-traditional route. After graduating from high school in Texas, she started at a four-year college and left after one semester.</p> <p>\"I just wasn't ready, and I didn't know what I wanted to do,\" she said.</p> <p>Instead of pursuing her education, Patty started working in real estate and was making enough money to be independent and own her own home. When her children came along, she made the decision to leave her job and dedicate herself to her family and her children's activities.</p> <p>Patty got involved with the PTA, a stay-at-home mom support group and even volunteered as a Girl Scout leader. It was these experiences that helped shape her future and inspired her decision to go back to school.</p> <p>\"I realized I wanted to do something meaningful and work in a job that meant something,\" Sturz said. \"But, I couldn't do that without a degree.\"</p> <p>For Patty, RACC was a great opportunity to take her core classes and at a lower cost. The daytime classes were also the perfect fit to allow her to not miss any time with her children, with whom she now compares test grades.</p> <p>She offers some advice to others who are thinking about going back to school.</p> <p>\"It can be a difficult transition from whatever your life was before, but it is definitely worth it and it can be done.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "It's Never Too Late", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/pattysturz.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/pattysturz.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

A graduate of RACC's Associate Degree Nursing Program in 2008, she is now entering her sixth year with Reading Health System and works in the emergency room.</p> <p>Ruth said it was a moment years ago growing up in Zambia, Africa that set her on the nursing path. \"I wanted to be a nurse since I was ten years old,\" said Ruth. \"My grandmother broke her leg around that time, and even though I don't remember this, she said I took great care of her and she said I would make a great nurse one day. So it kind of stuck with me.\"</p> <p>A few years later, family intervention again played a significant role in determining Ruth's future. She had extended family living in Berks County and was given the opportunity to move here to finish high school. She attended Holy Name High School, now named Berks Catholic, for her final three years. She said the transition and culture shock was a drastic change, but she is now adjusted and enjoys going back to visit her country. When it came time for college, Ruth talked with her high school guidance counselor.</p> <p>\"She had a lot of nice things to say about RACC in general, and that the nursing program was excellent,\" Ruth said. \"I trusted her, so I enrolled at RACC right out of high school. I thank her to this day for steering me in the right direction.\"</p> <p>The nursing program at RACC left Ruth feeling very well prepared, and she said she was confident starting her first day of work at the hospital. After a year at work, Ruth enrolled at Alvernia University to pursue a bachelor's degree, which she earned in 2010. \"I knew I always wanted to further my education and that it was just a matter of time,\" she said.</p> <p>For Ruth, the greatest rewards of a nursing career are helping people and seeing the healing process first-hand. \"Seeing hope in the eyes of a hopeless family member and knowing that hope came from my contribution to making their mother, father, brother, sister or child better makes everything worth it,\" Ruth said.</p> <p>A wife and mother, Ruth said nursing also allows a flexible schedule to balance family and work. In the future, she also hopes to return to school and earn a Master's degree. Ruth offers advice to students who are considering a career in nursing: \"Make sure you really love the career and that it is something that you truly want to do,\" she said. \"If you are in it for the wrong reasons, you will definitely find it hard to stay in the field. If it truly is your calling, you will always strive to see the bright side in everything.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "A Gift to Heal", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/muchimba.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/muchimba.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

It wasn't long ago that she was a student at RACC studying Anthropology.</p> <p>Jennifer, a graduate of Exeter High School, attended RACC from 2006 to 2009 and learned to make the most of each opportunity by participating in Legacy, the Honors Program and Phi Theta Kappa.</p> <p>\"<em>Legacy</em> published three of my essays and one photographic entry over two consecutive years,\" Jennifer said. \"I also served as the Submissions Editor for the journal and found the experience a very good starting point in academic publishing.\"</p> <p>Jennifer challenged herself with honors courses and found them not to be more difficult than other classes, but more in-depth. \"Positive benefits of honors courses include smaller class sizes, deeper teacher-student relationships, greater in-depth discussions of course topics, and the freedom to expand the exploration of the course materials,\" she said. \"I would recommend the honors classes to any student who desires a firmer grasp on the course subject as well as the classroom freedom to explore and study course topics on a much deeper level.\"</p> <p>The honors courses also put her in touch with Dr. Pamela Blakely, who was instrumental in assisting with the transfer process. Jennifer said she would offer several tips to RACC students who may be interested in transferring. \"Network with your professors and start your transfer process early,\" she said. \"Research your possible future colleges thoroughly via the Internet and discussions with your professors. Visit and tour the potential college campus several times if possible. Correspond with current students of your desired institutions.\"</p> <p>Once she settled into Smith, Jennifer took advantage of the opportunity to network with a visiting professor from England during a social event. That was the first step to her seven-week internship where she copy-edited articles, created an index for a forthcoming book, cataloged a library and helped edit an electronic database of recorded British Isles textiles.</p> <p>Jennifer said she honed her networking skills during some of the talks and lectures she attended through Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society for two-year colleges. \"I would recommend Phi Theta Kappa to any student, especially students planning to further their education at a four-year college,\" she said.</p> <p>After graduating from Smith next May, Jennifer hopes to attend graduate school and earn a doctoral degree.

Many community college honors students excelled in high school; others are \"late bloomers\" who hit their stride later on. All, however, share the same goal - building an excellent record of accomplishment and personal growth while in college and beyond.</p> <p><strong>What benefits are there in taking honors courses?</strong><br/> Plenty! These include a competitive edge when applying for jobs or transferring to four-year colleges, intellectually challenging curricula, individual attention from professors, and opportunities to interact and learn from other academically talented, motivated students.</p> <p><strong>How are honors courses different?</strong><br/> Classes are small, usually discussion style, seminars. Often fewer topics are dealt with than in standard classes, but in greater depth. There are increased opportunities to read, to conduct research, to write, and to do creative projects. In fact, the essence of honors education is exploratory, collaborative, and creative learning. Field trips and guest speakers also play an integral part in some honors courses.</p> <p><strong>Will my grade point average suffer if I enroll in honors courses?</strong><br/> Probably not. Research indicates that students who are appropriately enrolled in honors classes earn the same grades they would have received in standard classes. Some students feel they do even better in these small, supportive honors classes.</p> <p> Remember, too, these courses will be designated as \"honors\" on your academic record, making your transcript stand out from others. </p> <p><strong>If I am involved in honors, will I have time for anything else?</strong><br/> Honors students are usually serious about their education and give their studies top priority.

It also contains the PA and federal laws and regulations and Code of Ethics as they apply to auctioneers. </p> <p><strong>Procurement and Appraisal of Personal Property</strong> - The principles, techniques and procedures used to procure, appraise and sell antiques, general household items, furniture and glassware and coins.</p> <p><strong>Procurement and Evaluation of Real Estate</strong> - Procedures used to procure and evaluate real estate. It also discusses farm and livestock auctions.</p> <p><strong>Laws and Regulations</strong> - Record-keeping, formulating contacts, PA and federal laws and regulations as they apply to auctioneers.</p> <p><strong>Preparation for the Auction</strong> - Record-keeping, formulating business plans, and creating marketing techniques.</p> <p><strong>The Auction</strong> - The techniques and procedures necessary to conduct and conclude an auction.</p> <p><strong>Practicum</strong> - Students will take part in a minimum of 60 hours \"hands-on\" experience in the auction business under the supervision of the college and an approved PA Licensed Auctioneer.

This integrated systems approach incorporates:</p> <h3>Industrial-quality equipment</h3> <p>Students feel like they are learning in a real manufacturing facility. The learning systems feature state-of-the-art, industry-standard components and a range of component types so that students perform hands-on skills and activities on equipment found in manufacturing and industrial environments today and have the knowledge and skills for the entire scope of the technologies they will encounter.</p> <h3>Troubleshooting emphasis</h3> <p>The curriculum teaches troubleshooting with organized problem-solving methods. Many learning systems feature a computer-based fault insertion system, which automatically inserts faults and tracks students' troubleshooting activities.</p> <h3>Task-based, competency-based curriculum</h3> <p>The curriculum uses a task-based design where theory and hands on learning activities are structured around manufacturing- and industry-relevant tasks. All learning and tasks are competency-based. RACC reports grades and, in many courses, issues credit.</p> <h3>Multimedia and printed curriculum formats</h3> <p>Students learn by different methods: hearing the material, reading it, seeing demonstrations and trying it themselves. The individualized learning system addresses different learning styles by presenting the material both in printed workbooks and multimedia formats. The multimedia versions include extensive video, 3D simulations and interactive activities.</p> <p>Schedule: For maximum flexibility, participants' schedules will be arranged by the participant, sponsoring company and instructor, working within the lab hours. Lab hours vary by lab; a typical lab schedule is Monday-Friday, 7:30 am to 3:30 pm, Monday-Wednesday, 5:00 pm to 9:00 pm, and Saturday morning by appointment.</p> <p>Registrations are accepted anytime.

{"body": "<p><strong>Block Transfer:</strong> 60 transfer credits from an associate degree counted toward the first two years of students' general education requirements.</p> <p><strong>Direct Transfer Agreements:</strong> RACC and its partnership school have developed a pathway from RACC's associate to the transfer school's bachelor's degree. Within this agreement, the maximum number of credits students can transfer to the 4-year institution.</p> <p><strong>Dual Admission Agreement:</strong> These agreements guarantee students admission to one of the partner four-year schools. You must have completed an associate's degree with a minimum grade point average in order to qualify for the benefits of dual admissions. (Most institutions limit dual admissions to AA and AS students only). Additionally, most of the schools require a non-binding letter of intent before earning 30 college level-credits. Dual admissions students apply using a free application and may be entitled to a merit scholarship.</p> <p><strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):</strong> A MOU is an amendment to the original agreement, and may include extending or renewing the agreement, redefining a clause within the agreement, and/or notifying the transfer institution of any major changes to program or general education frameworks that may impact the alignment of programs or courses between the two institutions.</p> <p><strong>Program to Program (P2P):</strong> Transfer programs that directly align associate degree programs to bachelor degree programs, with the intention for seamlessly transferring credits without any loss of associate degree credits to the student. Community College transfer students through these P2P agreements are considered juniors at the 4-year partnership institution. RACC participates in P2P in state-wide agreements for Psychology and Early Childhood Teaching (Pre-K - Grade 4). These P2P's allow for seamless transfer to state and state-affiliated schools. Individual P2P's between RACC and transfer institutions exist for AAS Nursing to BSN and AAS Mechatronics to BS in Mechatronics.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Direct Equivalency:</strong> Course is a direct match to the transfer school's course.</p> <p><strong>General Elective:</strong> Course transfers into the transfer school's general education framework.</p> <p><strong>Program Elective:</strong> Course transfers an elective into the transfers school\u2019s program of study.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Glossary of Transfer Terms", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Transfer/terms.aspx", "path": "/Transfer/terms.aspx", "folder": "/Transfer"},

It is used by instructors to conduct live office hours, orientation, or class lectures so that students/participants from remote locations can attend these sessions via the Internet through Collaborate. </p> <p><strong> Do I need a separate username and password for a Collaborate session?</strong><br/> No, you don\u2019t. The sessions are created and set in your courses in Canvas.</p> <p><strong>My instructor set up a Collaborate session in my course in Canvas, how do I access it?</strong><br/> There will be a link to Blackboard Collaborate in one of your course Modules. Your instructor will direct you to the correct module. Click on the link to open the list of sessions. Find the appropriate session and click on the title to join. Once you have launched the meeting, the session download will begin and you will be prompted to install and accept the session. </p> <p><strong>Do I need special software?</strong> <br/> Collaborate uses a special launcher program. If you do not have it installed, you will be asked to install the launcher before you begin your first Collaborate session. There is a version for Windows and Mac.<br/> </p> <p><strong>Do I need special equipment?</strong><br/> No, as long as your computer has speakers so you can hear your instructor or facilitator, you can participate in a Collaborate session through a chat. However, to take full advantage of the collaborative capabilities during a session, a headset with a microphone is strongly recommended. Also, a webcam can be used if you want to be seen during the session.<br/> </p> <p><strong>Is there a tutorial I can review?</strong> <br/> You can watch the <a href=\"http://www.brainshark.com/blackboardinc/vu?pi=zGLzYw5XBz35Sgz0\">Collaborate Orientation</a> video tutorial to become familiar with its various features and functions.

His mom, though, sensed something was off.</p> <p>\"She asked how I felt about business and I said it was ok; but then she asked me what I really wanted to do,\" he said. \"I've always been passionate about helping people, so I wanted an education that would help me go out there and help people.\"</p> <p>Michael considered becoming a doctor, but realized the length of time required for schooling and the tuition bills that would quickly mount. Instead, he turned to nursing, realizing that some day he could continue his dream of becoming a doctor if he wanted. He is preparing to start his clinical rotation this fall en route to becoming a Registered Nurse.</p> <p>The question was where to go to school, and his mom suggested going to America and living with family in Reading.</p> <p>\"I said, 'Great, that's a brilliant option if it's possible,\" Michael recounted. \"I didn't realize it was really possible until she mentioned my uncle.\"</p> <div style=\"width: 200px; border: black thin solid; float:left; margin-right:8px; padding:8px\">Michael attended high school in Machakos, Kenya, which is less than a two-hour drive from the capital of Nairobi.<br/><br/>Languages spoken in Machakos include English, Swahili and local tribal dialects.<br/><br/>Kenya is named after Mount Kenya, the nation's highest peak at more than 17,000 feet.</div> <p>Possible it was\u2013\u2013 Michael enrolled at RACC in the spring of 2009 and didn't waste any time getting engrossed in college life. He started working at the Tutoring Center and joined the International Student Club, eventually becoming president.</p> <p>Michael also became an active participant in the Leadership Program, which offers four sessions a year geared toward developing leadership skills. \"It is a really good program for the College,\" Michael said. \"You learn a lot about yourself and you learn skills that you can apply in life and in school.\"</p> <p>As if that wasn't enough on his plate, Michael was also selected to be a Raven Ambassador. Each year, a small group of students is chosen from a pool of applicants to work with the Admissions Office and serve as true ambassadors of the College, including helping with events like open house and new student orientation.</p> <p>\"Working at orientation with new students is fun since I do like meeting people and socializing,\" he said. \"You also learn a lot of things you didn't know, like where to refer students who need help and how to get in contact with their advisors.\"</p> <p>While Michael is making the most of his time at RACC, he still misses his mom and younger brother he left behind in Kenya. He has not been back to visit, but works hard to keep in touch through email and Skype.</p> <p>After he completes the RN program at RACC, Michael would like to specialize in anesthetics. \"I don't know if I will definitely go back to Kenya or stay here,\" he said. \"If I get a job here, it would be good to experience the workforce and develop my skills before I would leave.\"</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "A Continent Away", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/muia.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/muia.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

JobTrakPA was made possible by a $20 million Department of Labor Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College Career Training (TAACCCT) grant awarded to the colleges last fall.</p> <p>\"Pennsylvania employers tell us that they have jobs waiting for workers with career-specific skills in several high-growth industries,\" said Dr. Alex Johnson, president of the Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges and president of the Community College of Allegheny County. \"Community colleges are part of a nationwide effort to provide a new skill-set to our workforce that will create career pathways for qualified workers in the shortest possible time.\"</p> <p>Currently, there are 15,000 TAA-eligible workers in Pennsylvania. The colleges, along with Pennsylvania CareerLink, are coordinating efforts to reach those workers and connect them to JobTrakPA for retraining and re-employment.</p> <p>Three high-growth, in-demand industries have been identified as priorities by the colleges. Training in these industries will be offered throughout the state, but will vary by regional needs:</p> <ul> <li>Advanced Manufacturing</li> <li>Energy Distribution, Production and Conservation</li> <li>Healthcare Information Technology</li> </ul> <p>Dr. Johnson noted that each of these industries is projected to grow substantially over the next few years, and highly-skilled workers are in demand.</p> <p>\"It is projected that there will be 4,800 job openings in advanced manufacturing in the coming years, over 32,000 job openings in energy distribution, production and conservation by 2016, and more than 9,000 job openings in healthcare information technology by 2016,\" Dr. Johnson said. \"As always, the community colleges stand poised and ready to respond to workforce needs. JobTrakPA will be a vital tool in getting Pennsylvanians trained and back to work.\"</p> <p>In addition to offering training, the community colleges have hired dedicated staff to help ensure students are successful at completing their courses. Following completion, staff will provide job placement assistance.

{"body": "<p><strong>A Founder and Friend</strong><br/> <em>In Memory of Mary Ann Chelius Smith</em><br/> </p> <p>Reading Area Community College lost a true friend, benefactor and founder with the passing of Mary Ann Chelius Smith on July 20, 2013. Mary Ann played a prominent role in the founding of RACC. From the beginning, she not only embraced the need for a community college in Reading, she also foresaw the dividends that RACC would pay back to the community, one student at a time. She did so despite the peril her advocacy caused to a promising political career and in the face of significant, sustained opposition.</p> <p>Over the years Mary Ann has served RACC as a member of the Foundation Board of Directors, College Trustee, active participant on innumerable committees and as a contributor to various special assignments. She served RACC concurrent with a long and successful career at Boscov\u2019s. Mary Ann brought passion, enthusiasm and great sensibility to everything that she did.\u00a0 We often marveled at her ability to cut to the chase despite the complexity of the problem or issue at hand. Although the details of her service to RACC would literally fill pages, she famously resisted any and all efforts to shine a light on her contributions, preferring instead to keep the focus on our students. In 2012, Mary Ann was the honoree for the Foundation for RACC\u2019s Celebration of Education Gala. In typical fashion she focused her attention not on the honor but on how she could use it to benefit our students.</p> <p>Some 43 years later, RACC has served more than 110,000 individuals, including nearly 11,000 graduates and tens of thousands more who used RACC as a springboard to employment, career advancement or further education. While our students are perhaps the greatest of Mary Ann\u2019s legacies, she would be the first to remind us that a sound future for RACC requires vision, courage and a continued belief in the power of education to transform both individuals and our community. The thriving College that we know today is proof positive that her heart and enthusiasm were wisely invested. We are deeply appreciative of all that she did to advance RACC and support our students.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Mary Ann Chelius Smith", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/MaryAnnCheliusSmith.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/MaryAnnCheliusSmith.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

One of the most significant is listed below.</p> <h3>ALL-USA ALL-PA Academic Team Scholarships<br/> </h3> <p>This nationwide competition sponsored by Phi Theta Kappa and several corporate partners recognizes high achieving two-year college students who demonstrate academic excellence and intellectual rigor combined with leadership and service that extends their education beyond the classroom to benefit society. Each community college with a Phi Theta Kappa chapter may nominate only two candidates for this competition. The Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges awards the All-PA Academic Team nominees from the 14 Pennsylvania community colleges two years\u2019 tuition to their choice of the 14 Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education universities, such as Kutztown, Millersville, West Chester. </p> <h3>Transfer Opportunities </h3> <p>Phi Theta Kappa's transfer database provides your profile to senior institutions throughout the United States.

Include activities you will be doing through the end of May.</p> <p>The Enhanced Membership Program year runs from June 1 to May 31. </p> <p>Through this program, you can give back to your community and develop a sense of civic awareness while supporting your chapter. In addition, you will discover talents you never knew you had.

However, we recognize that certain situations may prevent you from completing courses as planned.</p> <p>Withdrawing from some or all of your classes may have academic and financial implications. While sometimes withdrawing from some or all of your classes is the best long-term decision, it is important to consider the questions below before deciding to withdraw.</p> <h3>What is the difference between a drop and a withdrawal?</h3> <p>At the start of each semester there is a period of time when you can add or drop classes freely.</p> <p>After the add/drop period ends, you may withdraw from classes. Withdrawing from a class means that the class will permanently appear on your transcript with a \"W\" grade.</p> <h3>When can I drop or withdraw?</h3> <p>The last day to drop or withdraw varies by each class section, but you always have the first 20% of each class to drop without having a permanent record of the class on your transcript. If you need to withdraw from a class after add/drop period, you may do so until 80% into the class. After 80% of the class has passed, you may only withdraw if you get special permission. The add/drop/withdrawal schedule is available <a href=\"/Academics/calendar.aspx\">online</a>. You may drop a class until the \"census\" date and withdraw until the \"W end\" date.</p> <h3>Will I get a refund?</h3> <p>Any refund will depend on <a href=\"/Tuition/refund.aspx\">when you drop or withdraw</a>. The further you get into the semester, the smaller your refund.</p> <h3>How will withdrawing affect my financial aid?</h3> <p>Federal regulations determine how withdrawing will affect your financial aid in two ways: how your refund is processed and how your <a href=\"/FinancialAid/SAP.aspx\">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a> is calculated. Depending on when you withdraw, you may owe some of the semester's financial aid back. In addition, withdrawing from the whole semester may mean that you will need to start paying back loans sooner than expected.</p> <p>For SAP purposes, \"W\" grades count in the Pace and Quantitative categories. Pace requires that you complete at least 66% of the credits you attempt every semester. For example, if you enrolled in 12 credits and withdraw from 6 credits, your Pace for the semester will be 50%. This is below the Pace requirement of 66%. The Quantitative requirement of SAP states that you must complete your degree in no more than 150% of the required credits for that degree. If your degree requires 60 credits you must complete it in no more than 90 (150% of 60) attempted credits. If you have completed 80 credits and have withdrawn from 20 credits, you will have 100 attempted credits and will not meet the Quantitative requirement for SAP.</p> <h3>Will withdrawing affect me academically?</h3> <p>Sometimes withdrawing from classes can be helpful academically, especially if withdrawing from one or two classes gives you enough time and energy to do better in the classes you stay enrolled in. In addition, if an extra-curricular situation like a medical emergency comes up unexpectedly, it might be better to withdraw from the semester and return when you can again devote enough time and energy to your classwork.</p> <p>Classes with \"W\" grades do not count in your GPA. However, the number of courses you withdraw from may affect your academic standing, so you only want to withdraw if there is no way you can still complete the class(es) successfully. </p> <h3>Who can help me decide if I should withdraw?</h3> <p>We strongly recommend that you talk with your instructor(s) before withdrawing from any courses. Our instructors want you to be successful and will talk with you about how you are doing in class and what to expect in the remainder of class. Many times students think they are struggling in class, only to find out from the instructor that they are really doing just fine. In addition, your instructor may be willing to explore opportunities that could allow you to complete the course successfully.</p> <p>Once you talk with your instructor(s), your next step will be to talk with an advisor. There are many advisors at RACC who can help you review all your options. If you are a degree-seeking student, you are also assigned an advisor in your major. If you are unable to meet with your assigned advisor, you may also meet with another faculty advisor in your major or with the Assistant Dean of your <a href=\"/Academics/divisions.aspx\">academic division</a>. Advisors are also available in the <a href=\"default.aspx\">Advising Center</a> in Berks Hall 111 and in Berks Hall 209. Through these two offices, you can make an appointment to meet with an advisor or take advantage of their walk-in advising hours.</p> <p>If you are receiving financial aid (grants or loans), you must also talk with a Financial Aid staff person in Berks Hall 107 about how withdrawing will affect your current and future financial aid.</p> <p>If, after conferring with your instructor, advisor, and Financial Aid, you decide that withdrawing is the best option for you, you will submit the Withdrawal From All Courses form to Records in Berks Hall 107.</p> <h3>What is the process to drop a class?</h3> <p>Before you decide to drop a class, we strongly recommend that you meet with an advisor to make sure your decision to drop a class will not affect future semesters. During the add/drop period, you may drop a class online through WebAdvisor or by submitting a Schedule Change form to the Records Office in Berks Hall 107.</p> <h3>What is the process to withdraw from a class?</h3> <p>Before you decide to withdraw from a class, we strongly recommend that you meet with an advisor to make sure your decision to drop a class will not affect future semesters or your financial aid award. After the add/drop period, you may withdraw from some of your classes online through WebAdvisor or by submitting a Schedule Change form to the Records Office in Berks Hall 107.</p> <h3>What is the process to withdraw from all classes? </h3> <p>Before you decide to withdraw from all your classes, you are required to meet with an advisor to review how your decision will affect your financial aid award or SAP, your academic standing, or your progress towards a degree. During the discussion, you should talk with an advisor about why you are withdrawing, how you are doing in each of your classes, and your plans for returning to RACC for future semesters. An advisor cannot prevent you from withdrawing, but it is very important that you make an informed decision about withdrawing.</p> <p>With an advisor, you will complete a Withdrawal From All Courses form, which you will then submit to the Records Office in Berks Hall 107.</p> <h3>What happens if I stop going to class and do not withdraw?</h3> <p>Faculty can choose to initiate a withdrawal for students who stop attending their class, but they are not required to. It is your responsibility to withdraw if you are going to stop going to class. Otherwise, you might earn an \"F\" grade in that class, which will negatively affect your academic standing and financial aid SAP.</p> <h3>Can anyone prevent me from withdrawing?</h3> <p>No. Instructors, advisors, and Financial Aid will not tell you that you cannot withdraw, but they might give you reasons why you should not withdraw. However, the decision to withdraw from any or all courses is an important one and the decision is ultimately up to you.</p> <h3>How can I return to RACC after withdrawing?</h3> <p>After withdrawing from all your classes, your student record will remain active for 1 year and you may register without any additional steps for any semester in that year. If you are inactive at RACC for more than 1 year, you will be required to submit an <a href=\"/Admissions/Enrollment/returning.aspx\">application as a returning student</a>, which allows us to reactive your student account. For example, if you withdraw from Fall 2015, you may enroll in Spring 2016, Summer 2016, or Fall 2016 without submitting a new application, but if you do not enroll in these semesters and decide to return to RACC in Summer 2017, you will need to complete an application.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Withdrawing from Classes", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Academics/Advising/withdraw.aspx", "path": "/Academics/Advising/withdraw.aspx", "folder": "/Academics/Advising"},

He is one of 40 international students taking part in the program and just one of four from the United States.</p> <p>\"When I came to RACC, I started reading up on grants and scholarships and it enlightened me that there were all these doors of opportunity, I just had to take the steps,\" said Ryan. \"I want to tell other students that there can be so much more to the college experience than just taking classes and going home.\"</p> <p>Ryan was encouraged to pursue the semester abroad by Professor Mary Lou Kline, who thought he would make a good candidate.</p> <p>\"Ryan has a zest for life and is eager to try new adventures,\" she said. \"He is persistent and goes after what he wants. It is a very generous scholarship made possible by Mr. Danzer and the Danzer Foundation, and Ryan is exactly the type of student Mr. Danzer has in mind when making this scholarship available. I am sure that Ryan will reap the rewards of this wonderful opportunity.\"</p> <p>While the overall adventure of traveling to Europe is exciting, Ryan said he is most looking forward to exploring the history. A special language and orientation mini course will be offered before the semester starts to help the students adjust.</p> <p>\"The course is supposed to help us get used to the language and the culture,\" he said. \"It's also going to be a chance to visit some of their major businesses like Audi and Volkswagen.\"</p> <p>Ryan admits he was drawn to business at a young age, selling golf balls and refreshments on a local golf course at the age of 12, and later managing a privately-owned pet store by the time he was 15.</p> <p>\"I like to see things succeed,\" he said. \"People have goals and they can be really simple, but it's still something important to them. Just the idea of running something efficiently and maximizing effort appeals to me.\"</p> <p>He learned the commercial side of business marketing while working for Lamar Advertising for three years with the responsibility of attracting new clients. However, when the economy turned, Ryan found himself out of a job and looking at going back to school.</p> <p>\"To be honest, I never considered RACC until I started looking at credit prices and comparing programs,\" he said. \"I toured the campus and talked to some teachers and it made sense as a good starting point for me. I also like how involved RACC is in the community.\"</p> <p>Although he is currently majoring in business, Ryan also has an interest in education. He is currently working as an ESL aide in the kindergarten classes at Amanda Stout Elementary through a work-study position.</p> <p>Mary Lou knew he enjoyed working with children so she recommended Ryan as a counselor for a two-week summer day camp in Germany called Burzlebach. This means he gets to leave for Germany earlier and enjoy extra time abroad.</p> <p>Ultimately, Ryan plans to transfer and earn a bachelor's degree in Business Marketing and someday work in school administration.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Start at RACC, See the World", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/bertoldi.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/bertoldi.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

The purpose of this policy is to codify the position of the Foundation on anonymity and donor/prospect records. \"Records\" is construed to mean all files, including electronic data, containing information on donors or prospective donors to the Foundation.</p> <p><strong>I. Confidentiality Of Records: </strong><br/> The Executive Director shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of donor and prospect records. He or she may, in their discretion, make all or part of any record available to staff members or Foundation volunteers to assist them in executing their responsibility.</p> <p>The Foundation's auditors are authorized to review donor and prospect records as required for the purposes for which they are engaged.</p> <p>The Board of Directors may, by a majority vote, appoint a committee to review the donor/prospect records and report back to the Board. Any such committee shall respect the Foundation's significant interest in protecting the sensitive nature of those records.</p> <p><strong>II. Publication Of Donor Names: </strong><br/> Unless otherwise requested by the donor, the names of all individual donors will be listed in the college's annual report and/ or in other appropriate vehicles. The Foundation will not publish the amount of any donor's gift without the permission of the donor. Donors making gifts to the Foundation by bequest or when the information is already in the public domain are deemed to have granted such permission.</p> <p>Donors should be aware that the Foundation may, from time to time, publish the current market value of its endowments, from which a reader may be able to determine the approximate size of a donor's gift.</p> <p><strong>III. Honor/ Memorial Gifts:</strong><br/> The names and addresses of donors of memorial or honorary gifts may be released to the honoree, next of kin, or appropriate member of the immediate family, unless otherwise specified by the donor. Gift amounts are not to be released without the express consent of the donor.</p> <p><strong>IV. Anonymous Gifts:</strong><br/> The Executive Director is authorized to accept anonymous gifts to the Foundation.

These include the following sanctions: <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\"> <li>Disciplinary Warning: Oral or written notice to the student that the conduct in question is in violation of the Student Code of Conduct. It also serves as a warning that future misconduct could result in a more severe disciplinary action. A disciplinary warning may be issued by a Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) Team member without the right of appeal.</li> <li>Disciplinary Probation: A disciplinary probation is a disciplinary warning with the added stipulation that if the student is found guilty of a violation of the Student Code of Conduct during a specified probationary period, the student's continued enrollment at the College will be in jeopardy. Disciplinary probation may include the loss of privileges, or use of specific college facilities, mandatory meetings with specified staff, and/or restitution for damages incurred. The probationary period is limited to a maximum of one year from the date of the written notification of the decision.</li> <li>Interim suspension: Exclusion from classes and other privileges or activities (not to exceed 5 working days) pending final determination of an alleged violation. This action will be invoked only when: <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-roman\"> <li>the presence of the student on campus is detrimental and/or poses a threat to oneself and/or the members of the College community.</li> <li>when a student fails to comply with a College official's request to meet with the student for the purpose of investigating an incident. Failure to comply with this meeting request may result in a suspension from the College for the remainder of the semester. This action does not exempt the student from any course attendance policies and the student is still obligated to complete the missed coursework.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Suspension: Exclusion from the College and College-sponsored activities and/or exclusion from other privileges or activities from campus for a specific period of time (up to a maximum of one year from the date of the written notification of the decision).

The student must submit a written request for consideration for readmission to the college and must comply with the reinstatement requirements</li> <li>Expulsion: Permanent exclusion from the College and College-sponsored activities. An expulsion sanction will remain on the student's permanent academic record.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Disciplinary proceedings involving faculty alleged to have violated this Policy shall be conducted as provided for in accordance with relevant provisions of controlling law as well as the Faculty Contract. Disciplinary proceedings alleging violations of this Policy by staff shall be conducted in accordance with relevant provisions of controlling law as well as the Staff Contracts. The College may suspend the rights of access to the College's network pending the final disposition of any employee disciplinary action. Depending on the severity of the violation, employees of the College may be subject to formal personnel warnings, suspension, and even dismissal.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Peer-To-Peer (P2P) File Sharing</strong> <ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha\"> <li>The purpose of this section of the Policy is to detail the College's plans to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material by users of the College's computer network and information technology resources, without unduly interfering with the legitimate educational and research use of the network; and to provide for annual disclosures to students on the College's policies and sanctions related to unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, as required by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA). Additionally, this section is intended to mitigate the College's potential exposure to security risks and liabilities associated with the exploitation of P2P applications to illegally use, distribute and/or store copyrighted materials on the College's network.</li> <li>This section of the Policy applies to students, faculty, staff, College volunteers, and other members of the public who use the College's network and/or information technology resources.</li> <li>This section of the Policy also applies to the College's network and all other College information technology resources; any other information technology resource made available to the College community through a College vendor-sourced network; and other electronic device regardless of ownership when such device is actively using the College network or is otherwise interfacing with a College information technology resource. The physical location of any computer or other device is irrelevant to whether or not a violation of this Policy exists.</li> <li>The College is committed to preventing, in so far as practicable, the misuse of the College's computer network and other information technology resources, including but not limited to the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material by users of its computer network. It is the College's intent to maintain the integrity of its computer network, without unduly interfering with educational and research use, by utilizing the methods described in this Policy.

The College firewall recognizes most popular forms of P2P traffic.</li> <li>Students will be considered in violation of this policy if their Internet traffic is identifiable as using P2P programs or protocols and subject to disciplinary actions as set out in student disciplinary procedures.</li> <li>The College reserves the right to block the use of any application on the College's network when it has a reasonable basis to conclude that such application is being used for improper purposes in violation of this Policy.</li> <li>The College will comply with all valid subpoenas seeking the identity of a person alleged to have misused the College's information technology resources for illegal purposes.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Technology-based Deterrents <ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"> <li>The Director of Information Technology will utilize technology-based deterrents to combat the unauthorized distribution, downloading, uploading, streaming, scanning, storage or sharing of copyrighted material by users of the College's network, and will periodically confer with the Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs/ Provost to ensure that all such technology-based deterrents then employed by the College do not unduly interfere with legitimate educational and research uses of the College's network.</li> <li>At least one technology-based deterrent must be in use at all times with respect to the College Network. As determined appropriate from time to time by the Director of Information Technology, technology-based deterrents may include, but not be limited to, one or more of the following: <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\"> <li>bandwidth or traffic shaping</li> <li>traffic monitoring to identify abnormally high bandwidth users</li> <li>Internet content filtering to block or reduce illegal file sharing</li> <li>other commercial products designed to reduce or block illegal file sharing</li> </ol> </li> <li>For the purpose of implementing this Policy, the Director of Information Technology shall have directive authority over all vendors to the College to direct that such vendors use appropriate deterrents to reduce or prevent illegal file sharing and other violations of this Policy. When exercising such directive authority, the Director shall consult with the appropriate contract administration officer of the College and ensure that all corrective actions are taken in accord with relevant contract documents.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Summary of civil and criminal penalties for violation of federal copyright laws <ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"> <li>Copyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under Section 106 of Title 17 of the United States Code. These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work. In the file-sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement. Students, staff, and faculty who misuse computer technology resources in ways that violate the exclusive rights of copyright holders may be subject to the civil and criminal penalties listed in Section IV. H. 2. a-f. of this Policy. In addition, students who violate copyright laws and other misuses of computer technology resources are subject to the RACC disciplinary code that is included in Section III.C. 1. a- e of this Policy. Faculty and staff who violate copyright laws and other misuses of computer technology resources are subject to the RACC Employee sanctions listed in Section III.C.2. of this Policy</li> <li>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. A summary of the civil and criminal penalties for violation of Federal copyright laws is as follows: <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\"> <li>Infringer pays the actual dollar amount of damages and profits; or</li> <li>The law provides a range from $750 to $30,000 for each work infringed, unless the court finds that the infringement was willful. In such cases, the maximum penalty is increased to $150,000.</li> <li>The court may award attorneys' fees and court costs.</li> <li>The court can issue an injunction to stop the infringing acts.</li> <li>The court can impound the illegal works.</li> <li>The infringer can be sent to jail for up to 10 years.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The College will make readily available to enrolled and prospective students the College's policies and sanctions related to copyright infringement including: a statement that explicitly informs its students that the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject the student to civil and criminal liabilities; a summary of the penalties for violation of Federal copyright laws; and this Policy.</li> <li>Information Technology Services Department will publish and maintain a webpage devoted specifically to this Policy and P2P file sharing. Such webpage shall contain a list of FAQs and How-To Guides that instruct the campus community about appropriate and inappropriate uses of P2P applications; a summary of penalties for violation of Federal copyright laws; a summary of the results from the periodic review of the effectiveness of the College's plans to prevent the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials by users of the College's network; and a list of legal alternatives for downloading or otherwise acquiring copyrighted material.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Enforcement Procedures For Handling Unauthorized P2P File Sharing<br/> <br/> The federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) establishes certain requirements for online service providers (OSP) such as RACC concerning copyright infringement violations including registration of an agent with the U.S. Copyright Office; development and posting of updated copyright policies; adoption of \"notice and takedown\" procedures for alleged copyright infringing materials; and accommodation and non-interference with standard technical measures utilized by copyright owners to identify and protect their works. <ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"> <li>Under DMCA, RACC is considered an online service provider (OSP) for its students, faculty, and staff. DMCA requires the college to expeditiously respond to complaints it receives of copyright infringements. When notified, under penalty of perjury, by a copyright owner of infringing materials on a computer attached to the university network, the college will take immediate action to block network access to the computer and notify the owner of the computer. Network access will be restored after the infringing material is removed from the computer or within 14 days after receiving a proper counter-notification, unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the computer owner. A second violation may result in an extended loss of access privileges to the college network. Additionally, as an OSP, RACC may be served with a subpoena for the identity of the owner of a computer determined to contain infringing materials. RACC will comply with the subpoena.</li> <li>All copyright infringement notifications will be acted upon in accordance with the requirements of the DMCA. Allegations of copyright infringements found on RACC computer resources should be sent to the RACC DMCA Agent. The Senior Vice President of Finance &amp; Administrative Services for Reading Area Community College shall function as the College's DMCA agent.</li> <li>Alleged violations of the DMCA shall be received by the College's Agent for the Receipt of a Claimed Infringement (\"Designated Agent\"). The College's Agent shall document all alleged violations. IT shall respond to all DMCA notices. The receipts of such notices are to be logged in and tracked by IT. Attempts to identify the suspect computer(s) and user(s) will be made by IT staff. In the case of suspected offenders who are students, if successful identification is made, a copy of the notice and name of student(s) identified shall be referred to the Office of the Vice-President of Student Affairs. In the case of suspected faculty or staff who are successfully identified, the notice and name of the staff or faculty member(s) and relevant identifying information shall be referred to the employee's supervisor. In circumstances when criminal activity is suspected, the Director of Human Resources shall consult with legal counsel notifying any party.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Implementation</strong> <ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha\"> <li>A full version of this Policy will be found on the College's website, through the College's Learning Management Software system (LMS), in the Student Handbook, the Employee Handbook, and the Faculty Handbook.</li> <li>A statement regarding this Policy will be placed in all documents related to computer usage and Internet services provided by the College.</li> <li>Information Technology will publish and maintain a webpage devoted specifically to this Policy and P2P file sharing.

{"body": "<h2>RACC's Creation and Early Years </h2> <p>In 1963, Pennsylvania passed legislation authorizing the development of a statewide system of comprehensive community colleges. The legislation states that community colleges should be locally controlled, responsive to the educational and training needs of the areas they serve, geographically accessible to students and have low tuition.</p> <p> In September of 1970, the Board of Directors of the Reading School District voted to act as, sponsor of a community college and authorized that an application and proposed plan for establishing and operating the new institution be submitted to the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. At its January 15, 1971 meeting, the State Board of Education approved the application permitting the Reading School District to sponsor Reading Area Community College. The sponsor appointed an eleven-member Board of Trustees whose responsibility was to bring the college into existence and supervise its administration. Classes were held for the first time on October 13, 1971, with an enrollment of 265 students.</p> <p> <img alt=\"The Yocum Library\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"155\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About//About/images/East2_150.jpg\" width=\"155\"/>Initially students attended classes at many locations throughout Reading. In 1977, the college purchased the former Holiday Inn at Second and Penn Street. After extensive renovations to the building, administrative offices and credit programs were moved to the present riverfront campus in the fall of 1978.</p> <h2>Campus Grows, Berks County Becomes College Sponsor </h2> <p>By the fall of 1988, enrolled credit students numbered 1640 and more space was needed. RACC purchased 10 acres of land between its campus and the Schuylkill River that was used primarily for parking. In June of 1989, the East Shore Office Building, now named Penn Hall, was purchased to serve the growing student body that expanded to 3,231 credit students by the fall of 1994.</p> <p> Approximately 12,000 non-credit students are also served each year. Classes are conducted at Boyertown, Exeter, Hamburg, Muhlenberg, Reading and Wilson High Schools, the Reading-Muhlenberg Vocational Technical School in Berks County and at several other community sites.</p> <p><img alt=\"The Yocum Library\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"150\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About//About/images/yocum2.jpg\" width=\"200\"/>As the college grew, the resources of a single sponsoring school district became inadequate to sustain the required expansion. The majority of students lived in Berks County, outside of the Reading School District. The Berks County Board of Commissioners took the initiative to study the need for a broader base of financial support for RACC. In February of 1990, the commissioners appointed a fifteen-member Citizen Task Force to study the sponsorship issue. In their report presented to the commissioners on September 13, 1990, they stated, \u201cThe current situation, where one school district acts as sponsor, is unique in Pennsylvania, is contrary to economic development trends over the life span of the community college, and is clearly untenable in today\u2019s economic climate.\u201d In conclusion, they stated \u201cthere is a compelling case for sole sponsorship (of the college) by the county government and the required financial commitment by the county would be reasonable, cost effective and not overly burdensome to the taxpayers.\u201d At the October 4, 1990 meeting of the Berks County Board of Commissioners, they voted unanimously to sponsor Reading Area Community College effective July 1, 1991.</p> <h2>The Yocum Library</h2> <p>In 1992, Reading Area Community College launched its first capital campaign to secure private funds for a new library. The campaign goal of $1,750,000 was exceeded and $2,739,000 was raised for the project. Those gifts enabled the college to go beyond the original basic facility and include additional educational equipment and laboratories. With the matching funds provided by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a $7.54 million library was constructed.</p> <p> The Yocum Library, overlooking the Schuylkill River, opened in March of 1996. It includes conference rooms and a humanities center. This distinctive addition to the Reading skyline serves as the landmark building that marks the gateway to the city.</p> <h2>Campus Improvements &amp; Changing of the Guard</h2> <p>Penn Hall, formerly the East Shore Office Building, was totally renovated in 1995. It houses the Division of Health Professions and Business Division classrooms and laboratories. Its state of the art classrooms and computer equipment prepare students to succeed in the automated workplace.</p> <p>The Student Union Building had been a Zieger &amp; Sons Florists facility. It was opened in the fall of 1996. Currently the bookstore, student government and newspaper offices, a wellness center and a student lounge are located there.</p> <p>Berks Hall, the original campus building, was remodeled in 1996.The finished project incorporates landscaped pathways, lighting and outdoor lounge areas that transformed Reading Area Community College into an attractive, city-based campus.</p> <p>In late 1996, the college purchased a 2.4-acre tract of land between the Penn Street Bridge and the Front and Washington Streets parking garage from the City of Reading for a future building project. Also in 1996, the Reading Area Community College celebrated its 25th Anniversary.</p> <p>In the fall of 2002, RACC enrolled a record 3,800 credit students. The year also marked the retirement of the president of 17 years, Dr. Gust Zogas. The Board of Trustees named Dr. Richard Kratz, former vice president/dean of academic affairs, the fourth president of RACC. The College also hired its first director of information technology to carry out a 3-year plan to update computer and phone systems.</p> <h2>Evolution of Community Education and Workforce Development Programs </h2> <p>In 2005 the continuing education department, now known as the division of Workforce and Economic Development/Community Education, centralized in Schuylkill Hall, which previously bordered the campus as part of the Penske Corporation. The non-credit arm of the College had been housed in several locations throughout the city and county, so the centralization was intended to provide efficiency and convenience for its students.</p> <p>In the spring of 2006, the Schmidt Training and Technology Center (TTC) celebrated its grand opening. The project was funded by the College's second successful capital campaign with the intent of providing training for area business in advanced manufacturing skills, information technology, market knowledge, executive senior leadership, business performance and workforce readiness.</p> <h2>Miller Center for the Arts &amp; Gateway Building Newest Additions to RACC</h2> <p>The year of 2006 also brought major change to the campus. In addition to the opening of the TTC, the College began construction on the Miller Center for the Arts, a 500-seat theatre, which officially opened in June of 2007. The Yocum Library celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2007 and the College began transitioning from a 10-week term system to a 15-week semester system.</p> <p>In June of 2007, the College welcomed Dr. Anna D.Weitz as its fifth president. She was officially installed at an October Inauguration ceremony that was preceded by a weekend of celebratory activities.</p> <p>In August of 2008, the College officially began a 15-week semester system and also that fall adopted a new Mission statement.</p> <p>Students interested in Career Training Programs received a new place to call home in the fall of 2010 when RACC opened its Gateway Center for Career Training at 201 Penn Street. The Gateway Center houses non-credit certificate programs in Business Occupational Training and Medical Occupational Training that can lead to career opportunities in as little as six weeks to six months.</p> <h2>College Celebrates 40th Anniversary</h2> <p>The College celebrated its 40th anniversary as the Community's College on Sept. 21, 2011 with a program and reception honoring its community partners. The celebration featured comments and proclamations from the Berks County Board of Commissioners, local and state officials and current and past members of RACC\u2019s Board of Trustees. All marveled at the College\u2019s growth and success. RACC officially turned 40 on October 13, which is the first day classes were held in 1971.</p> <p></p>", "uid": "0", "title": "College History", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/About/history.aspx", "path": "/About/history.aspx", "folder": "/About"},

Part 106, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities operated by recipients of Federal financial assistance. Sexual harassment of any student or employee, which includes acts of sexual violence, is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. </p> <h3>Who is Covered by Title IX?</h3> <p>Educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance are covered by Title IX. If only one of the institution\u2019s programs or activities receives federal funding, all of the programs within the institution must comply with Title IX regulations. In compliance with Title IX, Reading Area Community College (RACC) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment as well as in all programs and activities.</p> <h3>Title IX Coordinator</h3> <p>In accordance with Title IX regulations, RACC has designated Patricia R. Helfenstein, Director of Grant Development &amp; Management, as the College\u2019s Title IX Coordinator. She is responsible for tracking and monitoring incidents of gender based discrimination, including misconduct, to ensure the college responds effectively to each complaint, and where necessary, for conducting investigations of particular situations. Questions regarding Title IX, as well as concerns and complaints of non-compliance, may be directed to her.</p> <h3>Complaints Under Title IX at RACC</h3> <p><strong>Students</strong>: If you are a student who believes you have been subjected to (1) sexual harassment by College faculty or staff; or (2) any other form of gender discrimination under Title IX, you may report such misconduct or file a formal complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in the Presidents Office Area. If you are a student who believes you have been or are the victim of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, sexual violence or other sexual misconduct, by another College student, you may report such conduct or file a complaint under Title IX with the Title IX Coordinator in the President\u2019s Office Area.</p> <p><strong>Employees</strong>: If you are an employee who believes you have been subjected to discrimination under Title IX, including sexual harassment, or who wishes to file a complaint under Title IX, you can do so with the Title IX Coordinator in the Presidents Office Area.</p> <p><a href=\"pdfs/CampusSaVEActVAWA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Campus SaVE Act and VAWA</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span><br/> <a href=\"pdfs/HarassmentProcedures-06-06-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Discrimination and Harassment Complaint Procedures</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span><br/> <a href=\"pdfs/HarassmentForm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Discrimination and Harassment Complaint Form</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span><br/> <a href=\"pdfs/SexualMisconductPolicyFAQ-2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ - Sexual Misconduct Policy</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span></p> <h3>Contact Information</h3> <p class=\"indentPara\"><strong>Patricia R.

She served as Class President for two years, earned top grades and had a plan for her future \u2013 start college at RACC.</p> <p>\u201cI was not ready to move out on my own, and the affordability made attending RACC the obvious choice,\u201d said Robyn, whose father attended RACC for the Licensed Practical Nursing program.</p> <p>Taking English Composition her first semester at RACC helped Robyn to solidify Communications/Journalism as her career choice. Speaking of the decision, Robyn said, \u201cI realized how much I enjoyed writing about people and that I was a good writer. Dr. (Bahar) Diken encouraged me to continue writing and to join Legacy, which has been a huge part of my time at RACC.\u201d</p> <p>Robyn was the Secretary of Legacy, which is RACC\u2019s award-winning scholarly journal. Her essay \u201cDigging Deeper: Are the Homeless Really Undeserving?\u201d appeared in Legacy XIII, Becoming Us which was published last spring.</p> <p>In addition to Legacy, she also served as Editor-in-Chief of Front Street Journal, helping to revive the College\u2019s newspaper which went on hiatus in early 2014.</p> <p>\u201cI am honored to be a part of the team that is getting FSJ back up again,\u201d she said. \u201cJoining FSJ also gave me more hands-on experience in my field, which is priceless. I want to write as a career and joining those clubs has allowed me to improve my writing, editing and publishing skills.\u201d</p> <p>Public speaking is another area where Robyn is gaining experience. As a scholarship recipient, she was invited to speak about her RACC experience at the annual scholarship dinner last November. She also presented at the Undergraduate Research Conference.</p> <p>Robyn appreciates that RACC pushed her toward independence while still providing a good support system. \u201cMy professors provided me with lots of information in their courses, which enriched my drive to learn and succeed. On the other hand, my professors allowed me to be independent enough to make my own decisions as far as what I wanted to write about or research,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Robyn graduated from RACC in May 2015 and transferred to Penn State University to pursue a journalism career. She\u2019d like to work for a major newspaper or news network and live in a major metropolitan area. \u201cI would love to have a job that would allow me to travel all over the world and improve the lives of others,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As she reflects back on her short time at RACC, she knows beginning her college journey at RACC was the right choice.</p> <p>\u201cBefore I went to RACC I did not know what to expect,\u201d said Robyn. \u201cSome of my classmates were surprised that I was attending RACC when I was Class President and very successful in high school, but I knew what was best for me.\u201d</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Finding Your Voice", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/RobynPhilactos.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/RobynPhilactos.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

{"body": "<img alt=\"Thomas Mease\" class=\"rightimage\" height=\"198\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/News/Features/images/ThomasMease.png\" width=\"297\"/> <p>Thomas Mease was sitting in a freshman computer class at Reading High School when a guest speaker came to give a presentation that would change his life. Mrs. Michelle Merkel, an instructor at Reading Muhlenberg Career and Technology Center, came to talk about a new opportunity for high school students to earn college credits.</p> <p>This new Technical Academy would be offered in partnership with Reading Area Community College and included an Information Technology Applications (ITA) track that sounded perfect to Thomas.</p> <p> \u201cShe was trying to get people to sign up for the CTC,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cI had already put in my application for the Engineering Technology shop, but I switched it to ITA so I could participate in the Tech Academy.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas is part of the first class of the ITA academy at RMCTC that encompasses eight courses from RACC\u2019s Business Management associate degree. Students can take five courses tuition-free at the CTC, including Introduction to Business, Financial Accounting and Microcomputer Applications. Three additional courses are available as Early Admissions students at RACC during their senior year of high school. In all, high school students can earn 24 college credits toward their associate degree before graduating.</p> <p>Thomas, who started his junior year ranked first in his class at Reading High School, said the Technical Academy gave him a pathway to college. As he plans to finish his associate degree at RACC and then transfer to a four-year school, he will be the first person in his family to attend college.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had an overall interest in technology and how different things work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to study computer science, make my own programs and maybe even video games.\u201d</p> <p>When he was younger, Thomas spent time learning about his computer and enjoying PC-based video games. The courses he enjoys most in the ITA Academy are related to computer software, hardware and programming.</p> <p>After finishing his morning classes at the CTC, he boards a bus with the other students and heads back for an afternoon of math, English and other required courses at Reading High.</p> <p>As one of the first students to experience this new opportunity, Thomas spends time speaking at Open House events and visits the Reading Intermediate High School to talk with 8th and 9th grade students. \u201cI think it really helps to have a peer to be able to talk with compared to an adult going in. I talk with students and answer questions about the CTC and the Tech Academy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Learn more about the opportunities available through the <a href=\"/Academics/technicalAcademy.aspx\">Berks County Technical Academy</a>.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Opening Doors through Early Admission", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/News/Features/ThomasMease.aspx", "path": "/News/Features/ThomasMease.aspx", "folder": "/News/Features"},

{"body": "<p><strong>What do I need to apply for financial aid at RACC?</strong><br/> You need to complete the <a href=\"http://www.fafsa.ed.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> (FAFSA). RACC's school code is 01038800. The FAFSA needs to be completed each year.</p> <p><strong>When should I apply?</strong><br/> As soon as possible. The FAFSA for the upcoming academic year is available every January 1; however, federal income taxes should be filed prior to completing the FAFSA every year. Students are encouraged to apply by May 1 prior to the academic year they plan to attend.</p> <p><strong>When is the deadline for financial aid at RACC?</strong><br/> To be considered for State aid and RACC scholarships, you must submit the FAFSA at least one week before May 1. You can complete the FAFSA anytime during your period of enrollment, but no later than June 30 of the end of the academic year, whichever comes first, for consideration for the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loan or Federal Direct PLUS Loan.</p> <p><strong>Do I have to be full-time to qualify for financial aid?</strong><br/> No. If eligible, you may qualify for aid with only one class. However, to receive most aid, including federal, state and loans you must be enrolled in at least 6 credits.</p> <p><strong>I know I don't qualify for aid, should I still complete the FAFSA?</strong><br/> Yes. Remember, your family's size, income and number of students in college is all taken into consideration when determining your eligibility. Even if you don't qualify for grants, you still need to have the FAFSA completed to be considered for certain scholarships, work study and Federal Direct Loans.</p> <p><strong>Where and when can I look for scholarships?</strong><br/> It is important to start looking as early as you can. Check with your High School Guidance Office, the college you plan on attending, local newspapers, the library, local business/organizations and the Internet. Do not participate in any scholarship searches that require you to pay a fee. You can get the same information for free from Internet searches at <a href=\"http://www.fastweb.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.fastweb.com</a> and your college Financial Aid Office.</p> <p><strong>How do I apply for a Federal Direct Loan?</strong><br/> The Master Promissory Note and Entrance Counseling must be completed at <a href=\"http://www.studentloans.gov\" target=\"_blank\">www.studentloans.gov</a>. </p> <p>A Loan Request Form can be <a href=\"pdf/FedLoanRequest16-17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">downloaded here</a> or picked up in the Financial Aid Office.</p> <p><strong>Are ESL classes eligible for financial aid?</strong><br/> Yes, but not for PHEAA State Grants.</p> <p><strong>I am not a U.S. Citizen. Will I qualify for financial aid?</strong><br/> To qualify for aid, non-U.S. Citizens must have an \"eligible non-citizen\" status. Contact the Financial Aid Office at the campus you plan to attend for additional information and eligibility requirements.</p> <p><strong>When will I find out about how much financial aid I will be receiving from RACC?</strong><br/> About 1-2 weeks after you complete the FAFSA on-line, you will receive an e-mail from the federal processor indicating your FAFSA has been processed. This is called your Student Aid Report (SAR). Read over the SAR and make any necessary corrections. PHEAA will notify you separately about your state grant eligibility. RACC mails out award letters approximately two weeks after the FAFSA is completed online, beginning April 1 for the upcoming academic year. <strong>Do not make any changes to your FAFSA/SAR after you receive an award letter from RACC.</strong> If you find you made an error and you have already received an award letter from RACC, contact the Financial Aid Office.</p> <p><strong>Why am I required to provide my parents' income information?</strong><br/> The Department of Education determines your dependency status and views the student (and their parents or spouse, if applicable) as the primary source of financial support for the student's post-secondary education. A student not living with their parents or claimed on the parents' federal income tax return does <strong>NOT</strong> by itself classify a student as independent. If you feel you have unusual family circumstances, contact the Financial Aid Office to inquire about a dependency override.</p> <p><strong>My family's income has decreased since I filed the FAFSA. Can my eligibility for financial aid be re-evaluated?</strong><br/> Yes. If your family has unusual circumstances such as loss of employment, loss of untaxed income or death of a parent or spouse, and the family income is significantly reduced, contact the Financial Aid Office to receive the appropriate paperwork for an income reduction.</p> <p><strong>I earned a Bachelor's degree in another country, would I qualify for financial aid?</strong><br/> You may be eligible for federal student loans and work-study programs. Any student, regardless of their citizenship status, with a bachelor's degree is not eligible for federal or state grants.</p> <p><strong>Can I use my financial aid to purchase books at the RACC bookstore?</strong><br/> Yes. If your aid has been awarded and it exceeds the charges on your semester bill, you can charge books against that excess. Take your schedule/bill and RACC ID to the RACC bookstore on the dates specified. We cannot advance you funds to purchase books online or at other bookstores.</p> <p><strong>How is enrollment status defined?</strong><br/> Full-time = 12 or more credits per term<br/> Three quarter-time = 9-11 credits per term<br/> Half-time = 6-8 credits per term<br/> Less than half-time = 1-5 credits per term</p> <p><strong>How is Berks County residency determined?</strong><br/> Billing is based on the address submitted on the Admissions Application. If you move into Berks County, you will need to bring official documentation (driver's license, utility bill, lease, etc.) to the Student Records Office to have your address changed and your billing updated.</p> <p><strong>How is Pennsylvania Residency Determined?</strong><br/> PHEAA State Grant eligibility is based on being a Pennsylvania resident for at least 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the filing date of the FAFSA application (exclusive of any period of time the student spend while enrolled in a Pennsylvania postsecondary educational institution). </p> <p><strong>I've just recently applied to RACC and just completed my FAFSA. Classes start soon, so what should I do about my bill?</strong><br/> Yes, you can still attend RACC. However, if you do not have financial aid present at the time your bill is due, you will need to pay at least 50 percent to the college. Acceptable payment will be cash, check, money order, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or a letter from your sponsor. Once the Financial Aid Office receives the results of your FAFSA and determines the amount of financial aid you can receive, we will credit it to your account. If you have financial aid in excess of what you owe, you will receive a refund during normal refund procedures/dates.</p> <p><strong>What happens to my financial aid if I withdraw during the semester?</strong><br/> Your withdrawal may affect your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters and could result in your having to repay all or a portion of your financial aid award to RACC or the Department of Education. Therefore, students are encouraged to meet with their professors and academic advisors, utilize tutorial services, and speak with a Financial Aid Advisor <strong>before</strong> withdrawing from RACC. Also, if you stop attending classes your aid may be backed out resulting in a balance owed to RACC. <a href=\"/Academics/Advising/withdraw.aspx\">Learn more about the withdrawal procedures here</a>.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Financial Aid FAQ", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/FinancialAid/FAQ.aspx", "path": "/FinancialAid/FAQ.aspx", "folder": "/FinancialAid"},

Your class doesn't meet on campus. You access your course materials and activities through the <a href=\"../Canvas/default.aspx\">Canvas</a> Learning Management System and/or other websites. However, some online courses might require some on-campus participation such as taking proctored tests on campus in the <a href=\"/Yocum/testing.aspx\">Academic Testing Center</a> or at an approved non-RACC testing facility elsewhere. This and/or other requirements are listed on the course section's \"Meeting Information/Comments\" column in the College course information system (<a href=\"https://webadvisor.racc.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor\" title=\"WebAdvisor-course information system-\">WebAdvisor</a>). For more information, watch the <a href=\"http://player.multicastmedia.com/player.php?p=r809z3p0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Searching for a Course in WebAdvisor tutorial\">Searching for a Course in WebAdvisor</a> tutorial.</p> <p>RACC also offers hybrid courses that use a combination of online technologies and face-to-face instruction. In a hybrid course, the time spent in the classroom is reduced while online instruction is used to meet learning objectives.</p> <p>In addition to credit courses, RACC also offers non-credit online courses for career training, personal development, workforce training and healthcare. You can learn more about those <a href=\"/CommunityEd/online_nonCredit.aspx\">non-credit online courses here</a>.</p> <h3>Is Online Learning The Right Choice For Me?</h3> <p>While online courses are convenient, they are not for everyone. Many times, students believe online courses are easier than traditional courses because you don't have to come to campus. However, online courses can be much harder, as you need to have excellent time management skills and the discipline to keep up with assignments. In addition, you need to have the confidence that you can succeed as an online student!</p> <p>Online learning classes are flexible. You can learn at times that are more convenient to you although online learning courses follow the same schedule (that is, start and end dates) as campus-based courses.</p>", "uid": "0", "title": "Online Learning", "url": "http://www.racc.edu/Online/default.aspx", "path": "/Online/default.aspx", "folder": "/Online"},

These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work. In the file-sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement.<strong></strong></p> <p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or \"statutory\" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For \"willful\" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorneys' fees. For details, see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.</p> <p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.</p> <p><strong>For more information, please see the website of the U.S. Copyright Office at </strong><a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov\"><strong>www.copyright.gov</strong></a><strong> </strong><strong>especially their FAQs at </strong><a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq\"><strong>www.copyright.gov/help/faq</strong></a><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Peer-to-Peer Programs (P2P)</strong></p> <p>Besides concerns about following federal copyright laws for course-based assignments, you should be aware that using the College\u2019s technology to share music and movies in digital format over the Internet using Peer-to-Peer Programs (P2P) in violation of copyright laws also might subject you to potential College sanctions and/or legal actions. <strong>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA</strong>) specifies procedures that RACC must follow when notified that an individual using our network is violating copyright laws. If the copyright holder contacts RACC about a violation, if we are able to trace the network address for the alleged time of violation, we notify the user of that network address, and require removal of the offending material from the computer. <strong>The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) </strong>is known to send pre-litigation settlement letters to Internet service providers (including colleges) to forward to students, suggesting payment of hundreds of dollars per song allegedly acquired illegally via the internet, instead of facing a possible lawsuit. Typically, if copyright infringement claims are settled out-of-court, the costs can be several thousand dollars per song, totaling tens of thousands of dollars per lawsuit.</p> <p><strong>RACC Policies Concerning Appropriate Use of Copyrighted Materials &amp; Technology:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"../Academics/Catalogs/AcademicHonestyPolicy.pdf\">RACC Academic Honesty and Copyright Policy </a></li> <li><a href=\"/IT/computer_policy.aspx\">RACC Computer Hardware and Software Usage Guidelines</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Sources For Legal Downloading:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.educause.edu/legalcontent\">EDUCAUSE Legal Sources of Online Content</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.mpaa.org/contentprotection/get-movies-tv-shows\">Motion Pictures Association of America</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://classguides.lib.uconn.edu/content.php?pid=52331&amp;sid=390694\">University of Connecticut Libraries </a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/jukebox/\">Library of Congress National Jukebox</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.archive.org\">Internet Archive</a></li> </ul> <p> <strong>Other Useful Internet Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu\">The Copyright Crash Course</a> from the University of Texas at Austin </li> <li><a href=\"http://librarycopyright.net/resources/digitalslider/\">Public Domain Slider</a> from the American Library Association </li> <li><a href=\"http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/comics/\">Tales From the Public Domain: Bound By Law?</a> A comic book from public domain scholars at the Duke University Law School </li> <li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InzDjH1-9Ns\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Copyright School</a></li> </ul> <h2>Additional Services for Distance Learning and Dual Enrollment Students</h2> <p>You are entitled to the same extensive library services as described above whether or not you are able to visit the campus.\u00a0 Contact <a href=\"mailto:PNouhra@racc.edu\">Patricia Nouhra</a>, Distance Learning Librarian, if you cannot come to campus to:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Create a library account </li> <li>Request <a href=\"onlineDatabases/allsubjects.aspx\">articles</a> from campus-only <a href=\"onlineDatabases/allsubjects.aspx\">online databases</a></li> <li>Request local delivery of <a href=\"http://catalog.berkslibraries.org/polaris/default.aspx?ctx=26.1033.0.0.5\" target=\"_blank\">library books and films</a></li> </ul> <h2>Additional Information for Parents &amp; Guardians of Dual Enrollment Students</h2> <p>You are welcome to visit The Yocum Library of Reading Area Community College. <br/> Many of our library resources may be used by the public.\u00a0 The Yocum Library uses the same library card as the Berks County public libraries.\u00a0 </p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"default.aspx\">Library Hours</a> </li> <li><a href=\"tour.aspx\">Library Virtual Tour</a></li> <li><a href=\"staff.aspx\">Library Staff</a></li> </ul> <h3>Informaci\u00f3n adicional para los padres y representantes de los estudiantes del programa de Dual Enrollment</h3> <p>Los invitamos a que visiten The Yocum Library de Reading Area Community College.

{"body": "<h2>Title IX</h2> <p>Title IX of the Education Amendments 1972 (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq.) and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 106, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities operated by recipients of Federal financial assistance. Sexual harassment of any student or employee, which includes acts of sexual violence, is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. </p> <h3>Who is Covered by Title IX?</h3> <p>Educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance are covered by Title IX. If only one of the institution\u2019s programs or activities receives federal funding, all of the programs within the institution must comply with Title IX regulations. In compliance with Title IX, Reading Area Community College (RACC) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment as well as in all programs and activities.</p> <h3>Title IX Coordinator</h3> <p>In accordance with Title IX regulations, RACC has designated Patricia R. Helfenstein, Director of Grant Development &amp; Management, as the College\u2019s Title IX Coordinator. She is responsible for tracking and monitoring incidents of gender based discrimination, including misconduct, to ensure the college responds effectively to each complaint, and where necessary, for conducting investigations of particular situations. Questions regarding Title IX, as well as concerns and complaints of non-compliance, may be directed to her.</p> <h3>Complaints Under Title IX at RACC</h3> <p><strong>Students</strong>: If you are a student who believes you have been subjected to (1) sexual harassment by College faculty or staff; or (2) any other form of gender discrimination under Title IX, you may report such misconduct or file a formal complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in the Presidents Office Area. If you are a student who believes you have been or are the victim of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, sexual violence or other sexual misconduct, by another College student, you may report such conduct or file a complaint under Title IX with the Title IX Coordinator in the President\u2019s Office Area.</p> <p><strong>Employees</strong>: If you are an employee who believes you have been subjected to discrimination under Title IX, including sexual harassment, or who wishes to file a complaint under Title IX, you can do so with the Title IX Coordinator in the Presidents Office Area.</p> <p><a href=\"pdfs/CampusSaVEActVAWA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Campus SaVE Act and VAWA</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span><br/> <a href=\"pdfs/HarassmentProcedures-06-06-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Discrimination and Harassment Complaint Procedures</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span><br/> <a href=\"pdfs/HarassmentForm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Discrimination and Harassment Complaint Form</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span><br/> <a href=\"pdfs/SexualMisconductPolicyFAQ-2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ - Sexual Misconduct Policy</a><span class=\"tiny_txt\"> - <img height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span></p> <h3>Contact Information</h3> <p class=\"indentPara\"><strong>Patricia R.

Information regarding OCR can be found at links below:</p> <h3>Failure to Comply with Title IX</h3> <p>The penalty for failure to comply with Title IX in the most extreme circumstances can include the termination of all or part of an institution\u2019s federal funding. This includes grants, subsidies, and other program funds from the federal government. In addition to the loss of federal funds, institutions may be sued by those seeking redress for violations of Title IX. It is essential that institutions receiving federal financial assistances operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. While compliance with the law is everyone\u2019s responsibility at RACC, the staff members who have primary responsibility for Title IX compliance are listed under Contact Information. </p> <h2>Title IX Information</h2> <p><a href=\"pdfs/Title-IX-Guide-For-Students-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Title IX Policy Guide for Students</a></p> <h2>Pregnancy/Parenting</h2> <ul style=\"list-style-type: none\"> <li> <h3>RACC Policy and Procedures</h3> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li><a href=\"pdfs/Title-IX-Pregnant-and-Parenting-Students.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">RACC Pregnant and Parenting Students Policy</a> <span class=\"tiny_txt\">- <img alt=\"PDF\" height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span></li> <li><a href=\"pdfs/Title-IX-Pregnancy-and-Parenting-Procedures.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">RACC Pregnancy and Parenting Procedure</a> <span class=\"tiny_txt\">- <img alt=\"PDF\" height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span></li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>Resources</h3> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li><a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/pregnancy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Supporting the Academic Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students</a> <span class=\"tiny_txt\">- <img alt=\"PDF\" height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pps_faq_at_dr_10.24.12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Pregnant and Parenting Students\u2019 Rights FAQ</a> <span class=\"tiny_txt\">- <img alt=\"PDF\" height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About/../images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Title IX: Resources for Victims</h2> <ul style=\"list-style-type: none\"> <li> <h3>Berks Women In Crisis</h3> <p>Berks Women in Crisis provides a safe haven and ongoing support system for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li> <a href=\"http://www.berkswomenincrisis.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.berkswomenincrisis.org</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>Know Your IX</h3> <p>A website to empower students.</p> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li> <a href=\"http://knowyourix.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://knowyourix.org</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs</h3> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li> <a href=\"http://www.avp.org/about-avp/national-coalition-of-anti-violence-programs\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.avp.org/about-avp/national-coalition-of-anti-violence-programs</a></li> </ul> <h3>National Domestic Violence Hotline</h3> <p>Established by the Violence Against Women Act, the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides twenty-four hour support for people facing domestic violence.</p> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li> <a href=\"http://www.thehotline.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thehotline.org</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>National Suicide Prevention Hotline</h3> <p>This nonprofit organization has a twenty-four-hour, toll-free confidential suicide prevention hotline.</p> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li> <a href=\"http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>National Women's Law Center</h3> <ul class=\"arrowList\"> <li> <a href=\"http://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Sexual-Harassment-and-Assault-in-Schools-A-Primer-for-Students-11.30.15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Sexual Harassment and Assault in Schools: A Primer for Students</a> - <span class=\"tiny_txt\"><img alt=\" Sexual Harassment and Assault in Schools: A Primer for Students\" border=\"0\" height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About//images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span> </li> <li> <a href=\"pdfs/Recognize&amp;CombatSexualHarassment.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">How to Recognize and Combat Sexual Harassment: A Primer for Students</a> - <span class=\"tiny_txt\"><img alt=\"How to Recognize and Combat Sexual Harassment: A Primer for Students\" border=\"0\" height=\"12\" src=\"/sites/default/files/imported/About//images/pdf_Icon.png\" width=\"12\"/> PDF</span> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>Not Alone</h3> <p>On January 22, 2014, President Obama established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.
